    "title": "Impact of Electron-Electron Cusp on Configuration Interaction Energies",
    "summary": "The effect of the electron-electron cusp on the convergence of configuration\ninteraction (CI) wave functions is examined. By analogy with the\npseudopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, an effective\nelectron-electron interaction is developed which closely reproduces the\nscattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero\nelectron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for this\nsmooth effective interaction has no cusp at zero electron-electron separation.\nWe perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, both\nwith the Coulomb electron-electron interaction and with the smooth effective\nelectron-electron interaction. We find that convergence of the CI expansion of\nthe wave function for the smooth electron-electron interaction is not\nsignificantly improved compared with that for the divergent Coulomb interaction\nfor energy differences on the order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to\npopular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting\nfactor, to within chemical accuracy, for CI calculations.",

    "summary": "Starting from the shell structure in atoms and the significant correlation\nwithin electron pairs, we distinguish the exchange-correlation effects between\ntwo electrons of opposite spins occupying the same orbital from the average\ncorrelation among many electrons in a crystal. In the periodic potential of the\ncrystal with lattice constant larger than the effective Bohr radius of the\nvalence electrons, these correlated electron pairs can form a metastable energy\nband above the corresponding single-electron band separated by an energy gap.\nIn order to determine if these metastable electron pairs can be stabilized, we\ncalculate the many-electron exchange-correlation renormalization and the\npolaron correction to the two-band system with single electrons and electron\npairs. We find that the electron-phonon interaction is essential to\ncounterbalance the Coulomb repulsion and to stabilize the electron pairs. The\ninterplay of the electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, manifested\nin the exchange-correlation energies, polaron effects, and screening, is\nresponsible for the formation of electron pairs (bipolarons) that are located\non the Fermi surface of the single-electron band.",

In collision-poor plasmas these nonequilibrium distributions are expected\nto be regulated by kinetic instabilities through wave-particle interactions.\nThis study considers electron instabilities driven by the interplay of core\nelectron temperature anisotropies and the electron beam, and firstly gives a\ncomprehensive analysis of instabilities in arbitrary directions to the\nbackground magnetic field. It clarifies the dominant parameter regime (e.g.,\nparallel core electron plasma beta $\\beta_{\\mathrm{ec\\parallel}}$, core\nelectron temperature anisotropy $A_{\\mathrm{ec}}\\equiv\nT_{\\mathrm{ec\\perp}}/T_{\\mathrm{ec\\parallel}}$, and electron beam velocity\n$V_{\\mathrm{eb}}$) for each kind of electron instability (e.g., the electron\nbeam-driven electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic instability, the electron\nbeam-driven whistler instability, the electromagnetic electron cyclotron\ninstability, the electron mirror instability, the electron firehose\ninstability, and the ordinary-mode instability). It finds that the electron\nbeam can destabilize electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic waves in the\nlow-$\\beta_{\\mathrm{ec\\parallel}}$ regime, and whistler waves in the medium-\nand large-$\\beta_{\\mathrm{ec\\parallel}}$ regime. It also finds that a new\noblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler instability is driven by the electron beam\nwith $V_{\\mathrm{eb}}\\gtrsim7V_{\\mathrm{A}}$ in a regime where\n$\\beta_{\\mathrm{ec\\parallel}}\\sim0.1-2$ and $A_{\\mathrm{ec}}&lt;1$.

    "summary": "Although both electron-ion and electron-electron bremsstrahlung contribute to\nthe hard X-ray emission from solar flares, the latter is normally ignored. Such\nan omission is not justified at electron (and photon) energies above $\\sim 300$\nkeV, and inclusion of the additional electron-electron bremsstrahlung in\ngeneral makes the electron spectrum required to produce a given hard X-ray\nspectrum steeper at high energies.\n  Unlike electron-ion bremsstrahlung, electron-electron bremsstrahlung cannot\nproduce photons of all energies up to the maximum electron energy involved. The\nmaximum possible photon energy depends on the angle between the direction of\nthe emitting electron and the emitted photon, and this suggests a diagnostic\nfor an upper cutoff energy and/or for the degree of beaming of the accelerated\nelectrons.\n  We analyze the large event of January 17, 2005 observed by RHESSI and show\nthat the upward break around 400 keV in the observed hard X-ray spectrum is\nnaturally accounted for by the inclusion of electron-electron bremsstrahlung.\nIndeed, the mean source electron spectrum recovered through a regularized\ninversion of the hard X-ray spectrum, using a cross-section that includes both\nelectron-ion and electron-electron terms, has a relatively constant spectral\nindex $\\delta$ over the range from electron kinetic energy $E = 200$ keV to $E\n= 1$ MeV. However, the level of detail discernible in the recovered electron\nspectrum is not sufficient to determine whether or not any upper cutoff energy\nexists.",

    "title": "Insights into the Electron-Electron Interaction from Quantum Monte Carlo\n  Calculations",
    "summary": "The effective electron-electron interaction in the electron gas depends on\nboth the density and spin local field factors. Variational Diagrammatic Quantum\nMonte Carlo calculations of the spin local field factor are reported and used\nto quantitatively present the full spin-dependent, electron-electron\ninteraction. Together with the charge local field factor from previous\nDiffusion Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we obtain the complete form of the\neffective electron-electron interaction in the uniform three-dimensional\nelectron gas. Very simple quadratic formulas are presented for the local field\nfactors that quantitatively produce all of the response functions of the\nelectron gas at metallic densities.\n  Exchange and correlation become increasingly important at low densities. At\nthe compressibility divergence at rs = 5.25, both the direct (screened Coulomb)\nterm and the charge-dependent exchange term in the electron-electron\ninteraction at q=0 are separately divergent. However, due to large\ncancellations, their difference is finite, well behaved, and much smaller than\neither term separately. As a result, the spin contribution to the\nelectron-electron interaction becomes an important factor. The static\nelectron-electron interaction is repulsive as a function of density but is less\nrepulsive for electrons with parallel spins.\n  The effect of allowing a deformable, rather than rigid, positive background\nis shown to be as quantitatively important as exchange and correlation. As a\nsimple concrete example, the electron-electron interaction is calculated using\nthe measured bulk modulus of the alkali metals with a linear phonon dispersion.\nThe net electron-electron interaction in lithium is attractive for wave vectors\n$0-2k_F$, which suggests superconductivity, and is mostly repulsive for the\nother alkali metals.",

In semiconductors,\nthese phenomena have been so far studied in relatively weak electron-electron\ninteraction regimes, where the single electron picture holds. However, SOC can\nprofoundly compete against Coulomb interaction, which could lead to the\nemergence of unconventional electronic phases. Since SOC depends on the\nelectric field in the crystal including contributions of itinerant electrons,\nelectron-electron interactions can modify this coupling. Here we demonstrate\nthe emergence of SOC effect in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron system\nin a simple band structure MgZnO/ZnO semiconductor. This electron system\nfeatures also strong electron-electron interaction effects. By changing the\ncarrier density with Mg-content, we tune the SOC strength and achieve its\ninterplay with electron-electron interaction.

Successive stages of extreme nonequilibrium on picosecond\ntime scale impact the excited material properties in terms of optical coupling\nand transport characteristics. As these are generally modelled based on the\nfree-electron classical theory, the free-electron number is a key parameter.\nHowever, this parameter remains unclearly defined and dependencies on the\nelectronic temperature are not considered. Here, from first-principles\ncalculations, density of states are obtained with respect to electronic\ntemperatures varying from 10^-2 to 10^5 K within a cold lattice. Based on the\nconcept of localized or delocalized electronic states, temperature dependent\nfree-electron numbers are evaluated for a series of metals covering a large\nrange of electronic configurations. With the increase of the electronic\ntemperature we observe strong adjustments of the electronic structures of\ntransition metals. These are related to variations of electronic occupation in\nlocalized d bands, via change in electronic screening and electron-ion\neffective potential. The electronic temperature dependence of nonequilibrium\ndensity of states has consequences on electronic chemical potentials,\nfree-electron numbers, electronic heat capacities, and electronic pressures.\nThus electronic thermodynamic properties are computed and discussed, serving as\na base to derive energetic and transport properties allowing the description of\nexcitation and relaxation phenomena caused by rapid laser action.",

    "summary": "We present an analytical study of the D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation time\nfor degenerate electrons in a photo-excited electron-hole liquid in intrinsic\nsemiconductors exhibiting a spin-split band structure. The D'yakonov-Perel'\nspin relaxation of electrons in these materials is controlled by electron-hole\nscattering, with small corrections from electron-electron scattering and\nvirtually none from electron-impurity scattering. We derive simple expressions\n(one-dimensional and two-dimensional integrals respectively) for the effective\nelectron-hole and electron-electron scattering rates which enter the spin\nrelaxation time calculation. The electron-hole scattering rate is found to be\ncomparable to the scattering rates from impurities in the electron liquid - a\ncommon model for n-type doped semiconductors. As the density of electron-hole\npairs decreases (within the degenerate regime), a strong enhancement of the\nscattering rates and a corresponding slowing down of spin relaxation is\npredicted due to exchange and correlation effects in the electron-hole liquid.\nIn the opposite limit of high density, the original D'yakonov-Perel' model\nfails due to decreasing scattering rates and is eventually superseded by free\nprecession of individual quasiparticle spins.",

    "summary": "We present a universal expression for the electronic friction as felt by a\nset of classical nuclear degrees of freedom (DoF's) coupled to a manifold of\nquantum electronic DoF's; no assumptions are made regarding the nature of the\nelectronic Hamiltonian and electron-electron repulsions are allowed. Our\nderivation is based on a quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE) for the\ncoupled electronic-nuclear motion, followed by an adiabatic approximation\nwhereby electronic transitions are assumed to equilibrate faster than nuclear\nmovement. The resulting form of friction is completely general, but does reduce\nto previously published expressions for the quadratic Hamiltonian (i.e.\nHamiltonians without electronic correlation). At equilibrium, the second\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem is satisfied and the frictional matrix is\nsymmetric. To demonstrate the importance of electron-electron correlation, we\nstudy electronic friction within the Anderson-Holstein model, where a proper\ntreatment of electron-electron interactions shows signatures of a Kondo\nresonance and a mean-field treatment is completely inadequate.",

    "title": "Emergence and spectral-weight transfer of electronic states in the\n  Hubbard ladder",
    "summary": "The number of electronic bands is usually considered invariant regardless of\nthe electron density in a band picture. However, in interacting systems, the\nspectral-weight distribution generally changes depending on the electron\ndensity, and electronic states can even emerge or disappear as the electron\ndensity changes. Here, to clarify how electronic states emerge and become\ndominant as the electron density changes, the spectral function of the Hubbard\nladder with strong repulsion and strong intrarung hopping is studied using the\nnon-Abelian dynamical density-matrix renormalization-group method. A mode\nemerging in the low-electron-density limit gains spectral weight as the\nelectron density increases and governs the dimer Mott physics at\nquarter-filling. In contrast, the antibonding band, which is dominant in the\nlow-electron-density regime, loses spectral weight and disappears at the Mott\ntransition at half-filling, exhibiting the momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion\nrelation in the small-doping limit. This paper identifies the origin of the\nelectronic states responsible for the Mott transition and brings a new\nperspective to electronic bands by revealing the overall nature of electronic\nstates over a wide energy and electron-density regime.",

The subsequent electronic evolutions in terms of band\nstructure and energy distribution can determine the change of several\nthermodynamic properties, including one essential for energy deposition; the\nelectronic heat capacity. Using density functional calculations performed at\nfinite electronic temperatures, the electronic heat capacities dependent on\nelectronic temperatures are obtained for a series of metals, including free\nelectron like, transition and noble metals. The effect of exchange and\ncorrelation functionals and the presence of semicore electrons on electronic\nheat capacities are first evaluated and found to be negligible in most cases.\nThen, we tested the validity of the free electron approaches, varying the\nnumber of free electrons per atom. This shows that only simple metals can be\ncorrectly fitted with these approaches. For transition metals, the presence of\nlocalized d electrons produces a strong deviation toward high energies of the\nelectronic heat capacities, implying that more energy is needed to thermally\nexcite them, compared to free sp electrons. This is attributed to collective\nexcitation effects strengthened by a change of the electronic screening at high\ntemperature.",

    "summary": "Suprathermal electrons and inertial drifting electrons, so called electron\nbeam, are crucial to the nonlinear dynamics of electrostatic solitary waves\nobserved in several astrophysical plasmas. In this paper, the propagation of\nelectron-acoustic solitary waves is investigated in a collisionless,\nunmagnetized plasma consisting of cool inertial background electrons, hot\nsuprathermal electrons (modeled by a $\\kappa$-type distribution), and\nstationary ions. The plasma is penetrated by a cool electron beam component. A\nlinear dispersion relation is derived to describe small-amplitude wave\nstructures that shows a weak dependence of the phase speed on the electron beam\nvelocity and density. A (Sagdeev-type) pseudopotential approach is employed to\nobtain the existence domain of large-amplitude solitary waves, and investigate\nhow their nonlinear structures depend on the kinematic and physical properties\nof the electron beam and the suprathermality (described by $\\kappa$) of the hot\nelectrons. The results indicate that the electron beam can largely alter the\nelectron-acoustic solitary waves, but can only produce negative polarity\nsolitary waves in this model. While the electron beam co-propagates with the\nsolitary waves, the soliton existence domain (Mach number range) becomes\nnarrower (nearly down to nil) with increasing the beam speed and the\nbeam-to-hot electron temperature ratio, and decreasing the beam-to-cool\nelectron density ratio in high suprathermality (low $\\kappa$). It is found that\nthe electric potential amplitude largely declines with increasing the beam\nspeed and the beam-to-cool electron density ratio for co-propagating solitary\nwaves, but is slightly decreased by raising the beam-to-hot electron\ntemperature ratio.",

In this paper, we analyze interaction of a pair of electrons with\nsuch an energy dispersion. We show that relative motion of the electron pair is\nof a very peculiar character. For example, the real space trajectories\ncorresponding to electron-electron scattering can have three reversal points,\nreversal points at non-zero radial momentum and other unusual features. Despite\nthe repulsive Coulomb interaction, two electrons can be coupled forming a\ncomposite quasi-particle - the bi-electron. The bi-electron corresponds to\nexcited states of the two-electron system. Because the bi-electron coupled\nstates exist in continuum of extended (free) states of the electron pair, these\nstates are quasi-resonant and have finite times of life. We found that rotating\nbi-electron is a long-living composite quasi-particle. The rotating\nbi-electrons can be in motion. For slowly moving bi-electrons, we determined\nthe kinetic energy and the effective mass. Due to strongly nonparabolic energy\ndispersion, the translational motion of the bi-electron is coupled to its\ninternal motion. This results in effective masses dependent on quantum states\nof the bi-electron. In the paper, properties of the bi-electron are illustrated\nfor the example of bigraphene in a transverse electric field.",

    "title": "Quantum-coherent light-electron interaction in an SEM",
    "summary": "The last two decades experimentally affirmed the quantum nature of free\nelectron wavepackets by the rapid development of transmission electron\nmicroscopes into ultrafast, quantum-coherent systems. In particular, ultrafast\nelectron pulses can be generated and timed to interact with optical\nnear-fields, yielding coherent exchange of the quantized photon energy between\nthe relativistic electron wavepacket and the light field. So far, all\nexperiments have been restricted to the physically-confining bounds of\ntransmission electron microscopes, with their small, millimeter-sized sample\nchambers. In this work, we show the quantum coherent coupling between electrons\nand light in a scanning electron microscope, at unprecedentedly low electron\nenergies down to 10.4 keV, so with sub-relativistic electrons. Scanning\nelectron microscopes not only afford the yet-unexplored electron energies from\n~0.5 to 30 keV providing optimum light-coupling efficiencies, but they also\noffer spacious and easily-configurable experimental chambers for extended and\ncascaded optical set-ups, potentially boasting thousands of photon-electron\ninteraction zones. Our results unleashes the full potential of quantum\nexperiments including electron wavepacket shaping and quantum computing with\nmultiple arithmetic operations and will allow imaging with low-energy electrons\nand attosecond time resolution.",

    "title": "Electrons surfing on a sound wave as a platform for quantum optics with\n  flying electrons",
    "summary": "Electrons in a metal are indistinguishable particles that strongly interact\nwith other electrons and their environment. Isolating and detecting a single\nflying electron after propagation to perform quantum optics like experiments at\nthe single electron level is therefore a challenging task. Up to date, only few\nexperiments have been performed in a high mobility two-dimensional electron gas\nwhere the electron propagates almost ballistically. Flying electrons were\ndetected via the current generated by an ensemble of electrons and electron\ncorrelations were encrypted in the current noise. Here we demonstrate the\nexperimental realisation of high efficiency single electron source and single\nelectron detector for a quantum medium where a single electron is propagating\nisolated from the other electrons through a one-dimensional channel. The moving\npotential is excited by a surface acoustic wave, which carries the single\nelectron along the 1D-channel at a speed of 3\\mum/ns. When such a quantum\nchannel is placed between two quantum dots, a single electron can be\ntransported from one quantum dot to the other, which is several micrometres\napart, with a quantum efficiency of emission and detection of 96% and 92%,\nrespectively. Furthermore, the transfer of the electron can be triggered on a\ntimescale shorter than the coherence time T2* of GaAs spin qubits6. Our work\nopens new avenues to study the teleportation of a single electron spin and the\ndistant interaction between spatially separated qubits in a condensed matter\nsystem.",

    "title": "Few-electron correlations after ultrafast photoemission from nanometric\n  needle tips",
    "summary": "Free electrons are essential in such diverse applications as electron\nmicroscopes, accelerators, and photo-emission spectroscopy. Often, space charge\neffects of many electrons are a nuisance. Confined to extremely small\nspace-time dimensions, even two electrons can interact strongly. In this case,\nthe Coulomb repulsion can now be highly advantageous, because it leads to\nsurprisingly powerful electron-electron correlations, as we demonstrate here.\nWe show that femtosecond laser-emitted electrons from nanometric needle tips\nare highly anti-correlated in energy because of dynamic Coulomb repulsion, with\na visibility of $56\\,\\%$. We extract a mean energy splitting of $3.3\\,$eV and a\ncorrelation decay time of $82\\,$fs. Importantly, the energy-filtered electrons\ndisplay a sub-Poissonian number distribution with a second order correlation\nfunction as small as $g^{(2)} = 0.34$, implying that shot noise-reduced pulsed\nelectron beams can be realized based on simple energy filtering. Even heralded\nelectrons could become available for quantum-enhanced electron imaging\nprotocols. Furthermore, we also reach the strong-field regime of laser-driven\nelectron emission. We gain deep insights into how the electron correlations of\nthe different electron classes (direct vs. rescattered) are influenced by the\nstrong laser fields. Our work levels the field of quantum electron optics, with\ndirect ramifications for shot noise-reduced and quantum electron imaging as\nwell as direct measurements of correlated electrons from inside of strongly\ncorrelated matter.",

    "title": "Excitation and Relaxation of Nonthermal Electron Energy Distributions in\n  Metals with Application to Gold",
    "summary": "A semiempirical theory for the excitation and subsequent relaxation of\nnonthermal electrons is described. The theory, which is applicable to\nultrafast-laser excited metals, is based on the Boltzmann transport equation\nfor the carrier distribution function $f(\\epsilon,t)$ and includes\nelectron-phonon, electron-electron, and electron-photon scattering integrals in\nforms that explicitly depend on the electronic density of states.\nElectron-phonon coupling is treated by extending the theory of Allen [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 59, 1460 (1987)] to include highly-excited nonthermal electron\ndistributions, and is used to determine the energy transfer rate between a\nnonthermal electron subsystem and a thermal phonon subsystem. Electron-electron\nscattering is treated with a simple energy-conserving electron-electron\nscattering integral. The electron-photon integral assumes photon absorption is\nphonon assisted. We apply the theory to analyze prior ultrafast thermionic\nemission, two-color photoemission, and electronic inelastic light (Raman)\nscattering experiments on Au. These analyses show that getting the details of\n$f(\\epsilon,t)$ is necessary for proper interpretation of each experiment.\nTogether, the photoemission and Raman-scattering analyses indicate an electron\nexcited 1 eV above the Fermi level has an electron-electron scattering time in\nthe range of 25 to 55 fs.",

We show that zero magnetic field\n`spin' splitting in quantum wires can lead to a dramatic `spin'-subband\ndependence of electron--electron scattering, including the possibility of\nstrong suppression.

    "summary": "Electron and phonon correlations in systems of one-dimensional electrons\ncoupled to phonons are studied at low temperatures by emphasizing on the effect\nof electron-phonon backward scattering. It is found that the $2k_F$-wave\ncomponents of the electron density and phonon displacement field share the same\ncorrelations. Both correlations are quasi-long-ranged for a single conducting\nchain coupled to one-dimensional or three-dimensional phonons, and they are\nlong-ranged for repulsive electron-electron interactions for a\nthree-dimensional array of parallel one-dimensional conducting chains coupled\nto three-dimensional phonons.",

Taking account of optical\nphonon emission and electron-electron scattering, we find that the inelastic\nscattering time $\\tau \\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1} \\mathrm{ps}$ and the mean free path\n$l \\sim 10-10^2 \\mathrm{nm}$ for electron densities $n = 10^{12}-10^{13}\n\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$.

Our results are directly applicable to device structures where\nballistic transport is relevant with inelastic scattering dominating over\nelastic scattering.",

Theoretically, the\nsmall-angle scattering exhibits distinct features that can be traced back to\nthe reduced dimensionality of the electron system. A number of nonlinear\neffects, also related to the two-dimensional character of the system, are\ndiscussed. In the simplest situation, the heating of the electron gas by the\nhigh-energy part of the beam leads to a weakening of the signal of\nquasiballistic electrons and to the appearance of thermovoltage.

We calculate the evolution of a coronal electron distribution through\nthe transition region in order to quantify the suprathermal electron population\nthere. A kinetic model for electrons is used which is based on solving the\nBoltzmann-Vlasov equation for electrons including Coulomb collisions with both\nions and electrons. Initial and chromospheric boundary conditions are\nMaxwellian VDFs with densities and temperatures based on a background fluid\nmodel. The coronal boundary condition has been adopted from earlier studies of\nsuprathermal electron formation in coronal loops. The model results show the\npresence of strong suprathermal tails in transition region electron VDFs,\nstarting at energies of a few 10 eV. Above electron energies of 600 eV,\nelectrons can traverse the transition region essentially collision-free. The\npresence of strong suprathermal tails in transition region electron VDFs shows\nthat the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is not justified there.\nThis has a significant impact on ionization dynamics, as is shown in a\ncompanion paper.",

Prior investigations of\nsketched quantum dot devices revealed a phase in which electrons form pairs,\nimplying a strongly attractive electron-electron interaction. Here, we show\nthat these devices with strong electron-electron interactions can exhibit a\ngate-tunable transition from a pair-tunneling regime to a single-electron\n(Andreev bound state) tunneling regime where the interactions become repulsive.\nThe electron-electron interaction sign change is associated with a Lifshitz\ntransition where the dxz and dyz bands start to become occupied.

    "summary": "When atoms are organized into a crystal, the single-electron energy levels of\nindividual atoms form energy bands. However, there also exist electron-pair\nstates in atoms. We found previously that the counterpart of these\nelectron-pair states of individual atoms may survive in a two-dimensional\nsquare-lattice crystal. When the amplitude of the crystal potential is larger\nthan a certain value, a metastable electron-pair band arises between the two\nlowest single-electron energy bands. In this paper, we demonstrate that the\nmany-particle exchange-correlation corrections renormalize the energy bands and\nmay stabilize the electron pairs for certain hole and electron-pair densities\nin the two-dimensional crystal. Therefore, depending upon the crystal potential\nand free carrier densities, there may exist a new many-particle system\nconsisting of electron pairs and holes. Furthermore, we calculate the\ncharge-density excitation spectrum in this new many-particle system.",

Here we investigate the\nhydrodynamic properties of Dirac electron fluid in graphene from a microscopic\nviewpoint, and elucidate a novel way to enhance electron hydrodynamics. In\nparticular, we present strong evidence that the shear viscosity of Dirac\nelectrons can be enhanced by frequent electron-hole collisions, through three\ndistinct aspects: promoting electrons and holes around the Dirac point by\ndisorder, creating electron-hole shared zeroth Landau level by external\nmagnetic field, and inducing electron-hole excitations by dynamic deformation.\nWe also study Hall viscosity, which is closely related to the geometric\ntopology and exhibits quantum behavior analogous to Hall conductivity.\nTherefore, our work demonstrates the exotic landscape of hydrodynamic\nelectronics in graphene, and presents experimentally relevant responses to\nquantify the effects of electronic viscosity.",

    "summary": "This paper describes the effects of electronic nonequilibrium in a simulation\nof ultrafast laser irradiation of materials. The simulation scheme based on\ntight-binding molecular dynamics, in which the electronic populations are\ntraced with a combined Monte Carlo and Boltzmann equation, enables the modeling\nof nonequilibrium, nonthermal, and nonadiabatic (electron-phonon coupling)\neffects simultaneously. The electron-electron thermalization is described\nwithin the relaxation-time approximation, which automatically restores various\nknown limits such as instantaneous thermalization (the thermalization time\n${\\tau}_{e-e} \\rightarrow 0$) and Born-Oppenheimer approximation (${\\tau}_{e-e}\n\\rightarrow \\infty$). The results of the simulation suggest that the\nnon-equilibrium state of the electronic system slows down electron-phonon\ncoupling with respect to the electronic equilibrium case in all studied\nmaterials: metals, semiconductors, and insulators. In semiconductors and\ninsulators, it also alters the damage threshold of ultrafast nonthermal phase\ntransitions induced by modification of the interatomic potential due to\nelectronic excitation. It is demonstrated that the models that exclude\nelectron-electron thermalization (using the assumption of ${\\tau}_{e-e}\n\\rightarrow \\infty$, such as BO or Ehrenfest approximations) may produce\nqualitatively different results, and a reliable model should include all three\neffects: electronic nonequilibrium, nonadiabatic electron-ion coupling, and\nnonthermal evolution of interatomic potential.",

    "summary": "In recent work, we discussed the difference between electrons and holes in\nenergy band in solids from a many-particle point of view, originating in the\nelectron-electron interaction[1], and from a single particle point of view,\noriginating in the electron-ion interaction[2]. We proposed that\nsuperconductivity in solids only occurs when the Fermi level is close to the\ntop of a band (hole carriers), that it originates in `undressing' of carriers\nfrom $both$ the electron-electron and the electron-ion interaction, and that as\na consequence holes in the normal state behave like electrons in the\nsuperconducting state[3]. However, the connection between both undressing\neffects was left unclear, as was left unclear how the transformation from hole\nbehavior to electron behavior occurs. Here we clarify these questions by\nshowing that the same electron-electron interaction physics that promotes\npairing of hole carriers and undressing of carriers from the electron-electron\ninteraction leads to undressing of carriers from the electron-ion interaction\nand transforms the behavior of carriers from hole-like to electron-like.\nFurthermore this phenomenon is connected with the expulsion of negative charge\nthat we predict to occur in superconductors. These unexpected connections\nsupport the validity of our theoretical framework, the theory of hole\nsuperconductivity, to explain superconductivity in solids.",

    "summary": "Coulomb blockade is a fundamental phenomenon in physics enabling transfer of\nindividual electrons one by one into electrically isolated nanostructures such\nas nanowires or quantum dots and thereby creation of sources of single\nelectrons. Nowadays, solid-state single-electron sources are key elements of\nthe emerging new technologies of quantum information processing and\nsingle-electron electronics. Moreover, advanced research in free-electron\nquantum optics and developments in electron microscopy require the point\nsources of free electrons in vacuum, which can be controlled on a single\nelectron level. However, up to now, single-electron vacuum guns were not\nrealized in practice. The problems to be solved include the formation of stable\ntip-shaped heterostructured emitters and control of liberated electrons in time\nand energy domain. Here we overcome these challenges by creating a field\nemission (FE) electron source based on a carbon nanowire coupled to an\nultra-sharp diamond tip by a tunnel junction. Using energy spectroscopy, we\ndirectly observe Coulomb oscillations of the electron Fermi level in the\nnanowire at room temperature and FE currents up to 1 $\\mu$A. We reveal that the\noscillations are suppressed at high FE current either by Joule heating or due\nto the high tunneling resistance, depending on the nanowire charging time,\nranging from about 25 fs to 1 ps. We anticipate that the combination of\nintroduced carbon single-electron sources with laser-induced gating is highly\npromising for the creation of coherent ultrashort free-electron bunches of\ninterest for low-energy electron holography and ultrafast electron or X-ray\nimaging and spectroscopy.",

    "summary": "Coherent electrons such as those in electron microscopes, exhibit wave\nphenomena and may be described by the paraxial wave equation. In analogy to\nlight-waves, governed by the same equation, these electrons share many of the\nfundamental traits and dynamics of photons. Today, spatial manipulation of\nelectron beams is achieved mainly using electrostatic and magnetic fields.\nOther demonstrations include simple phase-plates and holographic masks based on\nbinary diffraction gratings. Altering the spatial profile of the beam may be\nproven useful in many fields incorporating phase microscopy, electron\nholography, and electron-matter interactions. These methods, however, are\nfundamentally limited due to energy distribution to undesired diffraction\norders as well as by their binary construction. Here we present a new method in\nelectron-optics for arbitrarily shaping of electron beams, by precisely\ncontrolling an engineered pattern of thicknesses on a thin-membrane, thereby\nmolding the spatial phase of the electron wavefront. Aided by the past decade's\nmonumental leap in nano-fabrication technology and armed with light-optic's\nvast experience and knowledge, one may now spatially manipulate an electron\nbeam's phase in much the same way light waves are shaped simply by passing them\nthrough glass elements such as refractive and diffractive lenses. We show\nexamples of binary and continuous phase-plates and demonstrate the ability to\ngenerate arbitrary shapes of the electron wave function using a holographic\nphase-mask. This opens exciting new possibilities for microscopic studies of\nmaterials using shaped electron beams and enables electron beam lithography\nwithout the need to move the electron beam or the sample, as well as high\nresolution inspection of electronic chips by structured electron illumination.",

The single-particle electron and\nheavy-hole electronic shells are described by two-dimensional harmonic\noscillators. The electron-electron, electron-hole Coulomb as well as the\nshort-range electron spin-Mn spin and hole spin-Mn spin contact exchange\ninteractions are included. The electronic states of the photo-excited\nelectron-hole-Mn complex and of the final electron-Mn complex are expanded in a\nfinite number of configurations and the full interacting Hamiltonian is\ndiagonalized numerically. The emission spectrum is predicted as a function of\nphoton energy for a given number of electrons and different number of confined\nelectronic quantum dot shells. We show how emission spectra allow to identify\nthe number of electronic shells, the number of electrons populating these\nshells and, most importantly, their spin. We show that electrons not\ninteracting directly with the spin of Mn ion do so via electron-electron\ninteractions. This indirect interaction is a strong effect even when Mn\nimpurity is away from the quantum dot center.",

    "summary": "Most treatments of electron-electron correlations in dense plasmas either\nignore them entirely (random phase approximation) or neglect the role of ions\n(jellium approximation). In this work, we go beyond both these approximations\nto derive a new formula for the electron-electron static structure factor which\nproperly accounts for the contributions of both ionic structure and\nquantum-mechanical dynamic response in the electrons. The result can be viewed\nas a natural extension of the quantum Ornstein-Zernike theory of ionic and\nelectronic correlations, and it is suitable for dense plasmas in which the ions\nare classical and the conduction electrons are quantum-mechanical. The\ncorresponding electron-electron pair distribution functions are compared with\nthe results of path integral Monte Carlo simulations, showing good agreement\nwhenever no strong electron resonance states are present. We construct\napproximate potentials of mean force which describe the effective screened\ninteraction between electrons. Significant deviations from Debye-H\\\"uckel\nscreening are present at temperatures and densities relevant to high energy\ndensity experiments involving warm and hot dense plasmas. The presence of\ncorrelations between conduction electrons is likely to influence the\nelectron-electron contribution to the electron and thermal conductivity. It is\nexpected that excitation processes involving the conduction electrons (e.g.,\nfree-free absorption) will also be affected.",

    "summary": "We discuss galvanomagnetic and thermomagnetic effects in disordered\nelectronic systems focusing on intermediate temperatures, for which\nelectron-electron scattering and electron-impurity scattering occur at similar\nrates, while phonon-related effects can be neglected. In particular, we explore\nhow electric and thermal currents driven either by an electric field or by a\ntemperature gradient are affected by the interplay of momentum-dependent\nelectron-impurity scattering, electron-electron scattering, and the presence of\na magnetic field. We find that the electric resistance, the Seebeck coefficient\nand the Nernst coefficient are particularly sensitive to the momentum\ndependence of the electron-impurity scattering rate at intermediate\ntemperatures. A sufficiently strong momentum dependence of the\nelectron-impurity scattering rate can induce a sign change of the Seebeck\ncoefficient. This sign change can be suppressed by a perpendicular magnetic\nfield. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of the Seebeck coefficient\ncan be used for measuring the magnitude of the electron-impurity and\nelectron-electron scattering rates. The Nernst coefficient vanishes for\nmomentum-independent electron-impurity scattering, but displays a maximum at\nfinite temperatures once the momentum dependence is accounted for. By contrast,\nthe Hall coefficient and the Righi-Leduc coefficient display only a weak\ndependence on the momentum dependence of the electron-impurity scattering at\nintermediate temperatures.",

    "summary": "The dominant emission from bare strange stars is thought to be\nelectron-positron pairs, produced through spontaneous pair creation (SPC) in a\nsurface layer of electrons tied to the star by a superstrong electric field.\nThe positrons escape freely, but the electrons are directed towards the star\nand quickly fill all available states, such that their degeneracy suppresses\nfurther SPC. An electron must be reflected and gain energy in order to escape,\nalong with the positron. Each escaping electron leaves a hole that is\nimmediately filled by another electron through SPC. We discuss the collisional\nprocesses that produce escaping electrons. When the Landau quantization of the\nmotion perpendicular to the magnetic field is taken into account,\nelectron-electron collisions can lead to an escaping electron only through a\nmulti-stage process involving higher Landau levels. Although the available\nestimates of the collision rate are deficient in several ways, it appears that\nthe rate is too low for electron-electron collisions to be effective. A simple\nkinetic model for electron-quark collisions leads to an estimate of the rate of\npair production that is analogous to thermionic emission, but the work function\nis poorly determined.",

    "summary": "This paper describes a simple and general method for deriving the inelastic\ncollision term in the electron Boltzmann equation for scattering from a coupled\nelectron-phonon system, and applies the method to the case of doped polar\nsemiconductors. In the Born approximation, the inelastic differential\nscattering rate $W^{inel}$ can be expressed in terms of the nonequilibrium\ntotal dynamic dielectric function, which includes both electronic and lattice\ncontributions. Within the random-phase approximation $W^{inel}$ separates into\ntwo components: an electron-electron interaction containing the nonequilibrium\ndistribution function for excitations of the electron gas, and a Fr\\\"{o}hlich\ninteraction including the phonon distribution function and self-energy due to\npolarization of the electrons. Each of these two interactions is screened by\nonly the electronic part of the total dielectric function which contains the\nhigh frequency dielectric constant, unlike commonly used expressions which\ncontain the static dielectric constant. Detailed balance between plasmons and\nelectron-hole pairs in steady state is used to eliminate the nonequilibrium\nplasmon distribution from the Boltzmann equation, resulting in a dynamically\nscreened electron-electron collision term. The phonon self-energy modifies the\nlongitudinal optical phonon dispersion so that two hybrid normal modes\ncontribute to the electron-phonon collision term.",

    "title": "Kinetic Theory for Electron Dynamics Near a Positive Ion",
    "summary": "A theoretical description of time correlation functions for electron\nproperties in the presence of a positive ion of charge number Z is given. The\nsimplest case of an electron gas distorted by a single ion is considered. A\nsemi-classical representation with a regularized electron - ion potential is\nused to obtain a linear kinetic theory that is asymptotically exact at short\ntimes. This Markovian approximation includes all initial (equilibrium) electron\n- electron and electron - ion correlations through renormalized pair\npotentials. The kinetic theory is solved in terms of single particle\ntrajectories of the electron - ion potential and a dielectric function for the\ninhomogeneous electron gas. The results are illustrated by a calculation of the\nautocorrelation function for the electron field at the ion. The dependence on\ncharge number Z is shown to be dominated by the bound states of the effective\nelectron - ion potential. On this basis, a very simple practical representation\nof the trajectories is proposed and shown to be accurate over a wide range\nincluding strong electron - ion coupling. This simple representation is then\nused for a brief analysis of the dielectric function for the inhomogeneous\nelectron gas.",

    "summary": "We present a theoretical approach to determine the electronic properties of\nnanoscale systems exhibiting strong electron-electron and electron-phonon\ninteractions and coupled to metallic electrodes. This approach is based on an\ninterpolative ansatz for the electronic self-energy which becomes exact both in\nthe limit of weak and strong coupling to the electrodes. The method provides a\ngeneralization of previous interpolative schemes which have been applied to the\npurely electronic case extensively. As a test case we consider the single level\nAnderson-Holstein model. The results obtained with the interpolative ansatz are\nin good agreement with existing data from Numerical Renormalization Group\ncalculations. We also check our results by considering the case of the\nelectrodes represented by a few discrete levels which can be diagonalized\nexactly. The approximation describes properly the transition from the Kondo\nregime where electron-electron interactions dominate to the polaronic case\ncharacterized by a strong electron-phonon interaction.",

    "summary": "We present a numerical investigation of energy and charge distributions\nduring electron-beam-induced growth of W nanostructures on SiO2 substrates\nusing Monte Carlo simulation of electron transport. This study gives a\nquantitative insight into the deposition of energy and charge in the substrate\nand in already existing metallic nanostructures in the presence of the electron\nbeam. We analyze electron trajectories, inelastic mean free paths, and\ndistribution of backscattered electrons in different deposit compositions and\ndepths. We find that, while in the early stages of the nanostructure growth a\nsignificant fraction of electron trajectories still interact with the\nsubstrate, as the nanostructure becomes thicker the transport takes place\nalmost exclusively in the nanostructure. In particular, a larger deposit\ndensity leads to enhanced electron backscattering. This work shows how\nmesoscopic radiation-transport techniques can contribute to a model which\naddresses the multi-scale nature of the electron-beam-induced deposition (EBID)\nprocess. Furthermore, similar simulations can aid in understanding the role\nplayed by backscattered electrons and emitted secondary electrons in the change\nof structural properties of nanostructured materials during post-growth\nelectron-beam treatments.",

A nonequilibrium adiabatic\napproach is generalized to include large Coulomb repulsion through a\nself-consistent procedure and applied to the investigation of large molecules,\nsuch as fullerenes, within the Coulomb blockade regime. The focus is on the\nphonon thermal conductance which is quite sensitive to the effects of strong\nelectron-electron interactions within the intermediate electron-vibration\ncoupling regime. The electron-vibration interaction enhances the phonon and\nelectron thermal conductance, and it reduces the charge conductance and the\nthermopower inducing a decrease of the thermoelectric figure of merit. For\nrealistic values of junction parameters, the peak values of the thermoelectric\nfigure of merit are still of the order of unity since the phonon thermal\nconductance can be even smaller than the electron counterpart.",

    "summary": "We introduce the idea that the electronic band structure of a charge density\nwave system may mimic the electronic structure of graphene. In that case a\nclass of materials quite different from graphene might be opened up to exploit\ngraphene's remarkable electronic properties. The theory of such materials,\nalong with superconductivity, is based on the material's dynamical, rather than\nits static, properties. The charge density wave system turns out to have a\nnumber of requirements: (1) a specific wave geometry simply related to\ngraphene; (2) a self-consistency among the electrons that requires the net\nCoulomb and phonon-mediated parts of the electron-electron interactions to be\nattractive. We develop a model that leads to an analytical expression for the\ntotal energy in terms of the effective electron mass $\\mu$, the electron\ndensity $\\rho_0$, and the strength $\\tilde{\\nu}_{K}$ of the net\nelectron-electron interaction. For constant $\\mu&gt;0$ and $\\rho_0$, we examine\nthe limitations set upon $\\tilde{\\nu}_{K}$ by self-consistency, stability, and\nthe approximation in the electronic state calculation, and find them to be\nmutually compatible.

From the theory of\nsuperconductivity, we also know that mechanical vibrations of the crystal\nlattice can make the electron-electron interaction attractive. Analogously, if\na quantum dot interacts with a mechanical degree of freedom, the effective\ninteraction energy can be negative; that is, the electron-electron interaction\nmight be attractive. In this work, we propose and theoretically study an\nengineered electromechanical system that exhibits electron-electron attraction:\na quantum dot suspended on a nonlinear mechanical resonator, tuned by a bottom\nand a top gate electrode. We focus on the example of a dot embedded in a\nsuspended graphene ribbon, for which we identify conditions for\nelectron-electron attraction.

Here,\nwe report simple expressions that capture the interplay of e-e and e-p\ninteractions on electron distribution relaxation times. We observe a dependence\nof the dynamics on e-e and e-p interaction strengths that is universal to most\nmetals and is also counterintuitive. While only e-p interactions reduce the\ntotal energy stored by excited electrons, the time for energy to leave the\nelectronic subsystem also depends on e-e interaction strengths because e-e\ninteractions increase the number of electrons emitting phonons. The effect of\ne-e interactions on energy-relaxation is largest in metals with strong e-p\ninteractions. Finally, the time high energy electron states remain occupied\ndepends only on the strength of e-e interactions, even if e-p scattering rates\nare much greater than e-e scattering rates.",

A finite-size enhancement of the HHG signal\nis found and attributed to electrons backscattering off the lattice edges.\nAdditionally, with increasing strength of the electron-electron correlation an\nenhancement of the high-frequency regime of the HHG spectrum is found. This is\nattributed to the on-site Coulomb repulsion between electrons giving rise to a\nlocalized quiver motion of the electrons. The finite-lattice enhancement\ndominates the HHG spectra from a few harmonic orders until a threshold from\nwhich the correlational enhancement dominates. This threshold is determined by\nthe degree of correlation and decreases into the low-frequency regime for\nincreasing electron-electron correlation.

The anomalous Hall electric field and Hall voltage are generated\nowing to the skew scattering of electrons, side-jump, and anomalous velocity\neffects that appear as a result of the spin-orbit coupling. We study both\nballistic and hydrodynamic transport regimes which are realized depending on\nthe relation between the electron-electron mean free path and the channel\nwidth. Compact analytical expressions for the anomalous Hall field and voltage\nare derived. We demonstrate that both in the ballistic and hydrodynamic regime\nthe electron momentum relaxation in the bulk of the channel due to impurities\nor phonons is required for the anomalous Hall effect in contrast to the normal\nHall effect and conductivity that can appear due to the electron-electron\ncollisions combined with momentum relaxation at the channels edge scattering.",

Electronic relaxation\nrate is shown numerically to be on the scale from hundreds fs to tens ps, for\nelectron energy-level separations being in the broad range from about one\nLO-phonon energy to about three or four optical-phonon energies. Despite of\ndisplaying some resonance features, the electronic relaxation rate does not\nappear to be crucially dependent on the quantum dot size.",

    "title": "Impact of Electron-Hole Correlations on the 1T-TiSe2 Electronic\n  Structure",
    "summary": "Several experiments have been performed on 1T-TiSe2 in order to identify\nwhether the electronic structure is semimetallic or semiconducting without\nreaching a consensus. In this paper, we theoretically study the impact of\nelectron-hole and electron-phonon correlations on the bare semimetallic and\nsemiconducting electronic structure. The resulting electron spectral functions\nprovide a direct comparison of both cases and demonstrate that 1T-TiSe2 is of\npredominant semiconducting character with some spectral weight crossing the\nFermi level.",

    "summary": "We introduce a theory that exposes the fundamental and previously overlooked\nconnection between the correlation among electrons and the degree of quantum\ncoherence of electronic states in matter. For arbitrary states, the effects\nonly decouple when the electronic dynamics induced by the nuclear bath is\npure-dephasing in nature such that $[H^{S},H^{SB}]=0$, where $H^{S}$ is the\nelectronic Hamiltonian and $H^{SB}$ is the electron-nuclear coupling. We\nquantitatively illustrate this connection via exact simulations of a\nHubbard-Holstein molecule using the Hierarchical Equations of Motion that show\nthat increasing the degree of electronic interactions can enhance or suppress\nthe rate of electronic coherence loss.",

    "summary": "The incidence of very low energy electrons on metal surfaces is mainly\ndictated by the phenomenon of quantum mechanical reflection at the metal\ninterface. Low energy electron reflection is insignificant in higher energy\nregimes, where the more familiar secondary electron emission and electron\nbackscattering processes are the dominant features of the electron-metal\ninteraction. It is a highly controversial subject that has mostly emerged\nduring the last years. In this brief note we examine the source of the\ncontroversy, present some basic theoretical considerations, recommend a dataset\nof reliable experimental results for the reflection of low energy electrons\nfrom tungsten surfaces and discuss the suppression of reflected electrons by\nexternal magnetic fields in the light of applications in fusion devices.",

Here we present results from Monte Carlo simulations, showing the\nspace-time evolution of secondary electron cascades in diamond. These cascades\nfollow the impact of a single primary electron at energies between 0.5-12 keV,\nrepresenting the usual range for photoelectrons. The calculations describe the\nsecondary ionizations caused by these electrons, the three-dimensional\nevolution of the electron cloud, and monitor the equivalent instantaneous\ntemperature of the free-electron gas as the system cools during expansion. The\ndissipation of the impact energy proceeds predominantly through the production\nof secondary electrons whose energies are comparable to the binding energies of\nthe valence (40-50 eV) and the core electrons (300 eV) in accordance with\nexperiments and the models of interactions. The electron cloud generated by a\n12 keV electron is strongly anisotropic in the early phases of the cascade (t\n&lt;= 1 fs). At later times, the sample is dominated by low energy electrons, and\nthese are scattered more isotropically by atoms in the sample. The results show\nthat the emission of secondary electrons approaches saturation within about 100\nfs, following the primary impact. At an impact energy of 12 keV, the total\nnumber of electrons liberated in the sample is &lt;= 400 at 1000 fs. The results\nprovide an understanding of ionizations by photoelectrons, and extend earlier\nmodels on low-energy electron cascades (E=0.25 keV, [ziaja,ziaja2]) to the\nhigher energy regime of the photoelectrons.",

    "title": "Towards electron encapsulation. Polynitrile approach",
    "summary": "Is it possible to design a supramolecular cage that would \"solvate\" the\nexcess electron in the same fashion in which several solvent molecules do that\nco-operatively in polar liquids? Two general strategies are outlined for\n\"electron encapsulation,\" viz. electron localization using polar groups\narranged on the (i) inside of the cage or (ii) outside of the cage. The second\napproach is limited to polynitriles. We demonstrate that the latter faces a\nformidable problem: the electron attaches to the nitrile groups forming\nmolecular anions with bent C-C-N fragments. Since the energy cost of this\nbending is very high, for dinitrile anions in n-hexane, the binding energies\nfor the electron are very low and for mononitriles, these binding energies are\nlower still, and the entropy of electron attachment is anomalously small.\nDensity functional theory modeling of electron trapping by mononitriles in\nn-hexane suggests that the mononitrile molecules substitute for the solvent\nmolecules at the electron cavity, \"solvating\" the electron by their methyl\ngroups. Such \"solvated electrons\" resemble multimer radical anions in which the\nelectron density is shared (mainly) between C 2p orbitals in the solute/solvent\nmolecules, instead of existing as cavity electrons. The way in which the excess\nelectron density is shared by such molecules is similar to the way in which\nthis sharing occurs in large di- and poly- nitrile anions, such as\n1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11-octacyano-cyclododecane anion. The work thus reveals\nlimitations of the concept of \"solvated electron\" for organic liquids. It also\ndemostrates the feasibility of \"electron encapsulation.\"",

    "summary": "The shape of the electron is studied using lowest-order perturbation theory.\nQuantities used to probe the structure of the proton: form factors, generalized\nparton distributions, transverse densities, Wigner distributions and the\nangular momentum content are computed for the electron-photon component of the\nelectron wave function. The influence of longitudinally polarized photons,\ndemanded by the need for infrared regularization via a non-zero photon mass, is\nincluded. The appropriate value of the photon mass depends on experimental\nconditions, and consequently the size of the electron (as defined by the slope\nof its Dirac form factor) bound in a hydrogen atom is found to be about four\ntimes larger than when the electron is free. The shape of the electron, as\ndetermined from the transverse density and generalized parton distributions is\nshown to not be round, and the free electron is shown to be far less round than\nthe bound electron. An electron distribution function (analogous to the quark\ndistribution function) is defined, and that of the bound electron is shown to\nbe suppressed compared to that of the free electron. If the relative transverse\nmomentum of the virtual electron and photon is large compared with the electron\nmass, the virtual electron and photon each carry nearly the total angular\nmomentum of the physical electron (1/2), with the orbital angular momentum\nbeing nearly (-1/2). Including the non-zero photon mass leads to the\nsuppression of end-point contributions to form factors. Implications for proton\nstructure and color transparency are discussed.",

    "title": "Theory of the Electron Sheath and Presheath",
    "summary": "Electron sheaths are commonly found near Langmuir probes collecting the\nelectron saturation current. The common assumption is that the probe collects\nthe random flux of electrons incident on the sheath, which tacitly implies that\nthere is no electron presheath and that the flux collected is due to a velocity\nspace truncation of the electron velocity distribution function (EVDF). This\nwork provides a dedicated theory of electron sheaths, which suggests that they\nare not so simple. Motivated by EVDFs observed in Particle-In-Cell (PIC)\nsimulations, a 1D model for the electron sheath and presheath is developed. In\nthe model, under low temperature plasma conditions ($T_e\\gg T_i$), an electron\npressure gradient accelerates electrons in the presheath to a flow velocity\nthat exceeds the electron thermal speed at the sheath edge. This pressure\ngradient generates large flow velocities compared to what would be generated by\nballistic motion in response to the electric field. It is found that in many\nsituations, under common plasma conditions, the electron presheath extends much\nfurther into the plasma than an analogous ion presheath. PIC simulations reveal\nthat the ion density in the electron presheath is determined by a flow around\nthe electron sheath and that this flow is due to 2D aspects of the sheath\ngeometry. Simulations also indicate the presence of ion acoustic waves excited\nby the differential flow between electrons and ions in the presheath which\nresult in sheath edge fluctuations. The 1D model and time averaged PIC\nsimulations are compared and it is shown that the model provides a good\ndescription of the electron sheath and presheath.",

    "summary": "Transition metals with their densely confined and strongly coupled valence\nelectrons are key constituents of many materials with unconventional\nproperties, such as high-Tc superconductors, Mott insulators and\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides. Strong electron interaction offers a fast and\nefficient lever to manipulate their properties with light, creating promising\npotential for next-generation electronics. However, the underlying dynamics is\na fast and intricate interplay of polarization and screening effects, which is\npoorly understood. It is hidden below the femtosecond timescale of electronic\nthermalization, which follows the light-induced excitation. Here, we\ninvestigate the many-body electron dynamics in transition metals before\nthermalization sets in. We combine the sensitivity of intra-shell transitions\nto screening effects with attosecond time resolution to uncover the interplay\nof photo-absorption and screening. First-principles time-dependent calculations\nallow us to assign our experimental observations to ultrafast electronic\nlocalization on d-orbitals. The latter modifies the whole electronic structure\nas well as the collective dynamic response of the system on a timescale much\nfaster than the light-field cycle. Our results demonstrate a possibility for\nsteering the electronic properties of solids prior to electron thermalization,\nsuggesting that the ultimate speed of electronic phase transitions is limited\nonly by the duration of the controlling laser pulse. Furthermore, external\ncontrol of the local electronic density serves as a fine tool for testing\nstate-of-the art models of electron-electron interactions.

    "summary": "Ultrafast electron-photon spectroscopy in electron microscopes commonly\nrequires ultrafast laser setups. Photoemission from an engineered electron\nsource is used to generate pulsed electrons, interacting with a sample that is\nexcited by the ultrafast laser pulse at a specified time delay. Thus,\ndeveloping an ultrafast electron microscope demands the exploitation of\nextrinsic laser excitations and complex synchronization schemes. Here, we\npresent an inverse approach based on cathodoluminescence spectroscopy to\nintroduce internal radiation sources in an electron microscope. Our method is\nbased on a sequential interaction of the electron beam with an electron-driven\nphoton source (EDPHS) and the investigated sample. An electron-driven photon\nsource in an electron microscope generates phase-locked photons that are\nmutually coherent with the near-field distribution of the swift electron. Due\nto their different velocities, one can readily change the delay between the\nphotons and electrons arriving at the sample by changing the distance between\nthe EDPHS and the sample. We demonstrate the mutual coherence between the\nradiations from the EDPHS and the sample by performing interferometry with a\ncombined system of an EDPHS and a WSe2 flake. We assert the mutual frequency\nand momentum-dependent correlation of the EDPHS and sample radiation, and\ndetermine experimentally the degree of mutual coherence of up to 27%. This\nlevel of mutual coherence allows us to perform spectral interferometry with an\nelectron microscope. Our method has the advantage of being simple, compact and\noperating with continuous electron beams. It will open the door to local\nelectron-photon correlation spectroscopy of quantum materials, single photon\nsystems, and coherent exciton-polaritonic samples with nanometric resolution.",

Since\nthe strength of the Coulomb interaction increases with decreasing distance, a\ncollision experiment of single electrons would be an ideal way to investigate\nit. Moreover, it would be useful to study such a Coulomb collision in silicon\nsystem, which has been extensively studied for qubit applications but so far\nhas not been used for making Coulomb collisions at the single-electron level.\nHere, we made two series-coupled tunable-barrier single-electron pumps in\nsilicon and used one to inject a hot single electron into the other pump in\neach pumping cycle. The hot single electron collides with a cold single\nelectron confined in the other single-electron pump. We observed a current flow\ndue to ejection not only of the hot single electron but also of the confined\ncold single electron. The latter leads to an excess current at a current\nplateau at a certain voltage range. We also found that increasing the number of\ncold electrons from one to two increased the cold-electron current by at least\ntwofold.

Our full band-structure calculations indicate that actual\nlifetimes are the result of a delicate balance between localization, density of\nstates, screening, and Fermi-surface topology. A major contribution from\n$d$-electrons participating in the screening of electron-electron interactions\nyields lifetimes of excited electrons in copper that are larger than those of\nelectrons in a free-electron gas with the electron density equal to that of\nvalence ($4s^1$) electrons. In aluminum, a simple metal with no $d$-bands,\nsplitting of the band structure over the Fermi level results in electron\nlifetimes that are smaller than those of electrons in a free-electron gas.",

    "summary": "We have studied the bound states of the extra electron in a molecular wire,\ncorresponding to the physical situation of the electron tunneling through the\nwire. Based on formalism of the scattering operator that accounts for\nmany-electron interactions we have shown that the energy spectrum of the bound\nstates of the extra electron in a linear chain of three-dimensional scattering\ncenters substantially deviates for spectrum of independent single-electron\nstates of Bloch electrons in a system described by a single-electron effective\npotential. In particular, in the case of elemental wire consisting of the\ncenters with one electronic state per center, the number of states in the band\ncan be less than number of centers of the wire. These states form two bands\ninstead of single band and the bands exhibit non-analytical, square root\ndispersion in the vicinity of the point where both bands come together. These\nfindings are important for developing physically viable theory of electron\ntunneling in single molecular systems because the structure of spectrum of\nelectron's bound states and its relative position in respect to the Fermi\nlevels of electrodes determine specific mechanisms of electron transport\nthrough a molecular wire.",

    "summary": "The hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and the nuclear spins is\none of the main sources of decoherence for spin qubits when the nuclear spins\nare disordered. An ordering of the latter largely suppresses this source of\ndecoherence. Here we show that such an ordering can occur through a\nthermodynamic phase transition in two-dimensional (2D) Kondo-lattice type\nsystems. We specifically focus on nuclear spins embedded in a 2D electron gas.\nThe nuclear spins interact with each other through the RKKY interaction, which\nis carried by the electron gas. We show that a nuclear magnetic order at finite\ntemperature relies on the anomalous behavior of the 2D static electron spin\nsusceptibility due to electron-electron interactions. This provides a\nconnection between low-dimensional magnetism and non-analyticities in\ninteracting 2D electron systems. We discuss the conditions for nuclear\nmagnetism, and show that the associated Curie temperature increases with the\nelectron-electron interactions and may reach up into the millikelvin regime.\nThe further reduction of dimensionality to one dimension is shortly discussed.",

    "title": "Electron-electron interactions in graphene bilayers",
    "summary": "Electrons most often organize into Fermi-liquid states in which\nelectron-electron interactions play an inessential role. A well known exception\nis the case of one-dimensional (1D) electron systems (1DES). In 1D the electron\nFermi-surface consists of points, and divergences associated with low-energy\nparticle-hole excitations abound when electron-electron interactions are\ndescribed perturbatively. In higher space dimensions, the corresponding\ndivergences occur only when Fermi lines or surfaces satisfy idealized nesting\nconditions. In this article we discuss electron-electron interactions in 2D\ngraphene bilayer systems which behave in many ways as if they were\none-dimensional, because they have Fermi points instead of Fermi lines and\nbecause their particle-hole energies have a quadratic dispersion which\ncompensates for the difference between 1D and 2D phase space. We conclude, on\nthe basis of a perturbative RG calculation similar to that commonly employed in\n1D systems, that interactions in neutral graphene bilayers can drive the system\ninto a strong-coupling broken symmetry state with layer-pseudospin\nferromagnetism and an energy gap.",

EPW can calculate electron-phonon interaction self-energies,\nelectron-phonon spectral functions, and total as well as mode-resolved\nelectron-phonon coupling strengths. The calculation of the electron-phonon\ncoupling requires a very accurate sampling of electron-phonon scattering\nprocesses throughout the Brillouin zone, hence reliable calculations can be\nprohibitively time-consuming. EPW combines the Kohn-Sham electronic eigenstates\nand the vibrational eigenmodes provided by the Quantum-ESPRESSO package [1]\nwith the maximally localized Wannier functions provided by the wannier90\npackage [2] in order to generate electron-phonon matrix elements on arbitrarily\ndense Brillouin zone grids using a generalized Fourier interpolation. This\nfeature of EPW leads to fast and accurate calculations of the electron-phonon\ncoupling, and enables the study of the electron-phonon coupling in large and\ncomplex systems.",

    "summary": "We identify an intriguing feature of the electron-vibrational dynamics of\nmolecular systems via a computational examination of \\emph{trans}-polyacetylene\noligomers. Here, via the vibronic interactions, the decay of an electron in the\nconduction band resonantly excites an electron in the valence band, and vice\nversa, leading to oscillatory exchange of electronic population between two\ndistinct electronic states that lives for up to tens of picoseconds. The\noscillatory structure is reminiscent of beating patterns between quantum states\nand is strongly suggestive of the presence of long-lived molecular electronic\ncoherence. Significantly, however, a detailed analysis of the electronic\ncoherence properties shows that the oscillatory structure arises from a purely\nincoherent process. These results were obtained by propagating the coupled\ndynamics of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom in a mixed\nquantum-classical study of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian for\npolyacetylene. The incoherent process is shown to occur between degenerate\nelectronic states with distinct electronic configurations that are indirectly\ncoupled via a third auxiliary state by the vibronic interactions. A discussion\nof how to construct electronic superposition states in molecules that are truly\nrobust to decoherence is also presented.",

These waves identified as whistler mode waves, electrostatic\nsolitary waves, lower hybrid waves and electrostatic electron cyclotron waves,\nare observed in the same 12-sec waveform capture and in association with\nsignatures of active magnetic reconnection. The large amplitude waves in the\nelectron diffusion region are coincident with abrupt increases in electron\nparallel temperature suggesting strong wave heating. The whistler mode waves\nwhich are at the electron scale and enable us to probe electron dynamics in the\ndiffusion region were analyzed in detail. The energetic electrons (~30 keV)\nwithin the electron diffusion region have anisotropic distributions with\nT_{e\\perp}/T_{e\\parallel}&gt;1 that may provide the free energy for the whistler\nmode waves. The energetic anisotropic electrons may be produced during the\nreconnection process. The whistler mode waves propagate away from the center of\nthe 'X-line' along magnetic field lines, suggesting that the electron diffusion\nregion is a possible source region of the whistler mode waves.",

    "summary": "A hierarchy of measures of decoherence for many-electron systems that is\nbased on the purity and the hierarchy of reduced electronic density matrices is\npresented. These reduced purities can be used to characterize electronic\ndecoherence in the common case when the many-body electronic density matrix is\nnot known and only reduced information about the electronic subsystem is\navailable. Being defined from reduced electronic quantities, the interpretation\nof the reduced purities is more intricate than the usual (many-body) purity.\nThis is because the nonidempotency of the $r$-body reduced electronic density\nmatrix that is the basis of the reduced purity measures can arise due to\ndecoherence or due to electronic correlations. To guide the interpretation,\nexplicit expressions are provided for the one-body and two-body reduced\npurities for a general electronic state. Using them, the information content\nand structure of the one-body and two-body reduced purities is established, and\nlimits on the changes that decoherence can induce are elucidated. The practical\nuse of the reduced purities to understand decoherence dynamics in many-electron\nsystems is exemplified through an analysis of the electronic decoherence\ndynamics in a model molecular system.",

    "summary": "We show here the existence of the indirect coupling of electron and magnetic\nor nuclear ion spins in self-assembled quantum dots mediated by\nelectron-electron interactions. With a single localized spin placed in the\ncenter of the dot, only the spins of electrons occupying the zero angular\nmomentum states couple directly to the localized spin. We show that when the\nelectron-electron interactions are included, the electrons occupying finite\nangular momentum orbitals interact with the localized spin. This effective\ninteraction is obtained using exact diagonalization of the microscopic\nHamiltonian as a function of the number of electronic shells, shell spacing,\nand anisotropy of the electron-Mn exchange interaction. The effective\ninteraction can be engineered to be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic\nby tuning the parameters of the quantum dot.",

We use a\nmulti-body particle tracing code to simulate electron bunch propagation through\nthe setup and to calculate pulse durations at the sample position. Our\nsimulations show that electron bunches containing few thousands of electrons\nper bunch are only weakly broadened by space-charge effects and their pulse\nduration is thus close to the one of a single-electron wavepacket. With our\ncompact setup we can create electron bunches containing up to 5000 electrons\nwith a pulse duration below 100 femtoseconds on the sample. We use the\ndiffractometer to track the energy transfer from photoexcited electrons to the\nlattice in a thin film of titanium. This process takes place on the timescale\nof few-hundred femtoseconds and a fully equilibrated state is reached within\none picosecond.",

A recently developed TEBD algorithm, optimized for bosonic degrees of\nfreedom, is used to simulate the quantum dynamics of a wave packet launched\nagainst the electron-phonon coupled structure.

    "summary": "On the elementary level, electronic current consists of individual electron\ntunnelling events that are separated by random time intervals. The waiting time\ndistribution is a probability to observe the electron transfer in the detector\nelectrode at time $t+\\tau$ given that an electron was detected in the same\nelectrode at earlier time $t$. We study waiting time distribution for quantum\ntransport in a vibrating molecular junction. By treating the electron-vibration\ninteraction exactly and molecule-electrode coupling perturbatively, we obtain\nmaster equation and compute the distribution of waiting times for electron\ntransport. The details of waiting time distributions are used to elucidate\nmicroscopic mechanism of electron transport and the role of electron-vibration\ninteractions. We find that as nonequilibrium develops in molecular junction,\nthe skewness and dispersion of the waiting time distribution experience\nstepwise drops with the increase of the electric current. These steps are\nassociated with the excitations of vibrational states by tunnelling electrons.\nIn the strong electron-vibration coupling regime, the dispersion decrease\ndominates over all other changes in the waiting time distribution as the\nmolecular junction departs far away from the equilibrium.",

We focus on the regime, relevant to high-T_c superconductors, in\nwhich the electron correlations are dominant. We find that the electron-phonon\ninteraction can still have important signatures, even if many anomalies appear,\nand the overall effect is far from conventional. In particular in the\nparamagnetic phase the effects of phonons are much reduced in the low-energy\nproperties, while the high-energy physics can be strongly affected by phonons.\nMoreover, the electron-phonon interaction can still give rise to important\neffects, like phase separation and charge-ordering, and it assumes a\npredominance of forward scattering even if the bare interaction is assumed to\nbe local (momentum independent). Antiferromagnetic correlations reduce the\nscreening effects due to electron-electron interactions and revive the\nelectron-phonon effects.",

Since the ionization efficiency is more than 90%, the neutral\natom density in that domain is so low that the electron collisions cannot\nexplain the high electron flux observed experimentally. Indeed this is 100\ntimes higher than the collisional transport. In Hall thruster geometry, as ions\nare not magnetized the electric and magnetic field configuration creates a huge\ndifference in drift velocity between electrons and ions, which generates\nelectron cyclotron drift instability or $\\vec E \\times \\vec B$ electron drift\ninstability. Here we are focusing on collision-less chaotic transport of\nelectrons by those unstable modes generated by $\\vec E \\times \\vec B$ drift\ninstability. We found that in presence of these electrostatic modes electron\ndynamics become chaotic. They gain energy from the background waves which\nincreases electron temperature along perpendicular direction by a significant\namount, $T_{\\rm perp}/T_{\\rm parallel}\\sim 4$, and a significant amount of\ncrossfield electron transport is observed along the axial direction.",

We apply this methodology to electron-doped anatase TiO2 as\nan illustrative example. The simulated spectra indicate that electron-plasmon\ncoupling in TiO2 underpins the formation of satellites at energies comparable\nto those of polaronic spectral features. At variance with phonons, however, the\nenergy of plasmons and their spectral fingerprints depends strongly on the\ncarrier concentration, revealing a complex interplay between plasmon and phonon\nsatellites. The electron-plasmon interaction accounts for approximately 40% of\nthe total electron-boson interaction strength and it is key to improve the\nagreement with measured quasiparticle spectra.",

An electron wave function is\nprepared in two paths that pass on opposite sides of a gold nanoparticle, where\nplasmons are excited before the paths are recombined to produce electron\ninterference. We show that the measured spectra are consistent with theoretical\npredictions, specifically that the interference signal formed by inelastically\nscattered electrons is pi out of phase with respect to that formed by\nelastically scattered electrons. This technique is sensitive to the phase of\nlocalized optical modes because the interference signal amounts to a\nsubstantial fraction of the transmitted electrons.

It has yet to be clarified how low-energy electrons\ninteract with electrons and/or phonons in a superconductor during electron\ndetection. Here we report the detection property of a superconducting\nmicro-strip single-electron detector (SSED) for electrons with energy below 200\neV. The detection efficiency is estimated as at least 37 % when electrons\nimpinging on the stripline possess an energy of 200 eV. We also show that the\nminimum detectable energy of electrons is about 10 eV with our SSED, much lower\nthan those of ions, which implies that the electron-electron interaction plays\na significant role.

    "title": "Diamagnetic Susceptibility of Interacting Electrons System",
    "summary": "Paramagnetism or diamagnetism of a material are shown by parallel or\nantiparallel directions, respectively, of the induced magnetization under the\ninfluence of external magnetic field. Theoretical study of paramagnetic\nsusceptibility and diamagnetic susceptibility of non-interacting electrons\nsystem are well described by Pauli's spin susceptibility and Landau-Peierls'\norbital susceptibility, respectively. For interacting electron systems, the\nparamagnetic susceptibility has been widely studied by using Hubbard's electron\n- electron interaction. However, due to its smaller value, the diamagnetic\nsusceptibility has not been studied. To investigate the enhancement of an\ninteracting electrons system, we study a generalized space and time-dependent\norbital susceptibility of conduction electron with a repulsive Hubbard's\nelectron - electron interaction. By using the retarded Green function\nexpression of the space and time-dependent orbital susceptibility, we found\nthat the orbital susceptibility is enhanced when Hubbard's electron - electron\ninteraction is negative.",

    "title": "On the Role of Exchange Interaction in Magnetic Ordering and\n  Conductivity of Manganites",
    "summary": "A model of chemical bonding between ions in manganites involving covalent\none-electron $\\sigma$ bonding is suggested. The covalent one-electron $\\sigma$\nbonding gives rise to a strongly correlated state of electrons resulting from\nthe exchange interaction between electrons when they are simultaneously at\ncation and anion orbitals. The manifestation of the correlatred state is the\nspin and spatial ordering of the electrons resulting in the formation of a\nspin- ordered electron lattice. The conductivity of manganites in this model is\nthe consequence of displacement of the electron lattice (or its part) from one\nlocalization site to another and depends on the type of spin ordering of the\nelectrons in the electron lattice and the localization energy determined by the\nenergy of the one-electron $\\sigma$ bond. The model also assumes a strong\npolarization of an anion by cations, which facilitates the 3s2p hybridization\nof the anion and transition of one of the pairs of 2p electrons from the\nsinglet state into the triplet state. This transition leads to formation of the\nspin-polarized electron lattice (electron spins are parallel) and ferromagnetic\nordering of manganese ions. In the model, the effect of colossal\nmagnetoresistance is explained by a change of the conductivity mechanism on\napplication of an external magnetic field, i.e., transition from the\nconductivity mechnism typical of an ionic crystal to the conductivity provided\nby the spin-polarized electron lattice.",

    "summary": "Images of electron flow through a two-dimensional electron gas from a quantum\npoint contact (QPC) can be obtained at liquid He temperatures using scanning\nprobe microscopy (SPM). A negatively charged SPM tip depletes the electron gas\nimmediately below it and decreases the conductance by backscattering electrons.\nImages of electron flow are obtained by recording the conductance as the tip is\nscanned over the sample. These images show angular patterns that are\ncharacteristic of electron flow through individual modes of the QPC, as well as\nwell-defined branches at longer distances. The addition of a prism formed by a\ntriangular gate bends electron paths as the electron density is reduced under\nthe prism by an applied gate voltage. Under the conditions of the experiment,\nelectron-electron scattering is the dominant inelastic process. By observing\nhow the amplitude of backscattered electrons in images of electron flow\ndecreases with added electron energy, we are able to determine the average\nlength and time necessary for inelastic scattering. A dc voltage Vo applied\nacross the QPC accelerates electrons so that their energy is greater than the\nFermi energy before inelastic scattering occurs. The signal is observed to\ndecrease in amplitude and eventually disappear at distances from the QPC that\ndecrease progressively as Vo is increased.",

    "summary": "Optical and electronic phenomena in solids arise from the behaviour of\nelectrons and holes (unoccupied states in a filled electron sea). Electron-hole\nsymmetry can often be invoked as a simplifying description, which states that\nelectrons with energy above the Fermi sea behave the same as holes below the\nFermi energy. In semiconductors, however, electron-hole symmetry is generally\nabsent since the energy band structure of the conduction band differs from the\nvalence band. Here we report on measurements of the discrete, quantized-energy\nspectrum of electrons and holes in a semiconducting carbon nanotube. Through a\ngate, an individual nanotube is filled controllably with a precise number of\neither electrons or holes, starting from one. The discrete excitation spectrum\nfor a nanotube with N holes is strikingly similar to the corresponding spectrum\nfor N electrons. This observation of near perfect electron-hole symmetry\ndemonstrates for the first time that a semiconducting nanotube can be free of\ncharged impurities, even in the limit of few-electrons or holes. We furthermore\nfind an anomalously small Zeeman spin splitting and an excitation spectrum\nindicating strong electron-electron interactions.",

    "title": "Impact of environmentally induced fluctuations on quantum mechanically\n  mixed electronic and vibrational pigment states in photosynthetic energy\n  transfer and 2D electronic spectra",
    "summary": "Recently, nuclear vibrational contribution signatures in 2D electronic\nspectroscopy have attracted considerable interest, in particular as regards\ninterpretation of the oscillatory transients observed in light-harvesting\ncomplexes. These transients have dephasing times that persist for much longer\nthan theoretically predicted electronic coherence lifetime. As a plausible\nexplanation for this long-lived spectral beating in 2D electronic spectra,\nquantum-mechanically mixed electronic and vibrational states (vibronic\nexcitons) were proposed by Christensson et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B 116, 7449\n(2012)] and have since been explored. In this work, we address a dimer which\nproduces little beating of electronic origin in the absence of vibronic\ncontributions, and examine the impact of protein-induced fluctuations upon\nelectronic-vibrational quantum mixtures by calculating the electronic energy\ntransfer dynamics and 2D electronic spectra in a numerically accurate manner.\nIt is found that, at cryogenic temperatures, the electronic-vibrational quantum\nmixtures are rather robust, even under the influence of the fluctuations and\ndespite the small Huang-Rhys factors of the Franck-Condon active vibrational\nmodes. This results in long-lasting beating behavior of vibrational origin in\nthe 2D electronic spectra. At physiological temper- atures, however, the\nfluctuations eradicate the mixing and, hence, the beating in the 2D spectra\ndisappears. Further, it is demonstrated that such electronic-vibrational\nquantum mixtures do not necessarily play a significant role in electronic\nenergy trans- fer dynamics, despite contributing to the enhancement of\nlong-lived quantum beating in 2D electronic spectra, contrary to speculations\nin recent publications.",

    "summary": "A electron of mass $m$, when electrically scatters of nucleus, of mass $M$,\ntransfers momentum $q$ to the nucleus.

The resulting energy goes in exciting the\natom to a higher energy state as in Frank Hertz experiment and sodium, neon,\nmercury vapor lamps, or ionization of atom as in bubble and cloud chamber\nexperiments, or just production of X-rays as in Bremsstraulung. In this paper,\nwe study these phenomenon. These experiments are inelastic scattering\nexperiments. We remark, why neutrinos donot scatter and can penetrate earth,\nwhy muons travel further than electrons in materials and why a material like\nlead plate can slow down electrons and positrons efficiently. We look at the\nelastic scattering of electrons as in electron diffraction and electron\nmicroscopes. We look at scattering of electrons in the condensed matter, these\nphenomenon range from scattering of electrons of periodic potential, to give\nBloch waves, scattering of electrons of phonons and impurities to give\nresistance, scattering of electrons of lattice to give cooper pairs and\nsuperconductivity. We study electron scattering from exchange potential as in\nFermi liquid theory and resulting $T^2$ resistance at low temperatures.\nElectron scattering of exchange potential resulting in chemical reactions.

Moreover we accept the notion of phase norm for\ntwo electrons to resolve the electronic correlation problem. The phase norm is\nused to specify the electron-approachable limit between particles. We take into\nconsideration the electronic correlation with the help of a correlation-hole\nfunction in terms of the phase norm, by which multiplying the integrand of the\noperator term representing the interaction between electrons. Using the phase\nnorm leads to analytical consideration of the electronic correlation without\nemploying in a factitious way the additional term pertaining to correlation, so\nit embodies the physical essence of electronic correlation.

    "summary": "Electron-boson interaction is fundamental to a thorough understanding of\nvarious exotic properties emerging in many-body physics. In photoemission\nspectroscopy, photoelectron emission due to photon absorption would trigger\ndiverse collective excitations in solids, including the emergence of phonons,\nmagnons, electron-hole pairs, and plasmons, which naturally provides a reliable\npathway to study electron-boson couplings. While fingerprints of\nelectron-phonon/-magnon interactions in this state-of-the-art technique have\nbeen well investigated, much less is known about electron-plasmon coupling, and\ndirect observation of the band renormalization solely due to electron-plasmon\ninteractions is extremely challenging. Here by utilizing integrated oxide\nmolecular-beam epitaxy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we\ndiscover the long sought-after pure electron-plasmon coupling-induced low-lying\nplasmonic-polaron replica bands in epitaxial semimetallic SrIrO$_3$ films, in\nwhich the characteristic low carrier concentration and narrow bandwidth combine\nto provide a unique platform where the electron-plasmon interaction can be\ninvestigated kinematically in photoemission spectroscopy. This finding enriches\nthe forms of electron band normalization on collective modes in solids and\ndemonstrates that, to obtain a complete understanding of the quasiparticle\ndynamics in 5d electron systems, the electron-plasmon interaction should be\nconsidered on equal footing with the acknowledged electron-electron interaction\nand spin-orbit coupling.",

Although, recently, keV electron beams have been\nused to excite broadband radiation from material chips, there remains a quest\nfor a chip-size free-electron laser capable of emitting coherent radiation.\nUnfortunately, those keV emitters from electron microscopes or dielectric laser\naccelerator usually deliver a small current with discrete moving electrons\nseparated by a distance of a few or tens of microns. To envisage a chip-size\nfree-electron laser as a powerful research tool, we study in this paper\nachievable laser radiation from a single electron and an array of single\nelectrons atop a nano-grating dielectric waveguide. In our study, thanks to the\nstrong coupling between the electron and the guided wave in a structure with\ndistributed feedback, a single 50-keV electron generates 1.5-um laser-like\nradiation at the Bragg resonance of a 31-um long silicon grating with a 400-nm\nthickness and 310-nm period. When driven by a train of single electrons\nrepeating at 0.1 PHz, the nano-grating waveguide emits a strong laser radiation\nat the second harmonic of the excitation frequency. A discrete spectrum of\nSmith-Purcell radiation mediated by the waveguide modes is also predicted in\ntheory and observed from simulation in the vacuum space above the grating\nwaveguide. This study opens up the opportunity for applications requiring\ncombined advantages from compact high-brightness electron and photon sources.",

    "summary": "Many low electron density Drude (LEDD) materials such as transparent\nconductive oxide or nitrides have recently attracted interest as alternative\nplasmonic materials and future nonlinear optical materials. However, the\nrapidly growing number of experimental studies has so far not been supported by\na systematic theory of the electronic, thermal and optical response of these\nmaterials. Here, we use the techniques previously derived in the context of\nnoble metals to go beyond a simple electromagnetic modelling of low electron\ndensity Drude materials and provide an electron dynamics model for their\nelectronic and thermal response. We find that the low electron density makes\nmomentum conservation in electron-phonon interactions more important, more\ncomplex and more sensitive to the temperatures compared with noble metals;\nmoreover, we find that electron-electron interactions are becoming more\neffective due to the weaker screening. Most importantly, we show that the low\nelectron density makes the electron heat capacity much smaller than in noble\nmetals, such that the electrons in LEDD materials tend to heat up much more and\ncool down faster compared to noble metals. While here we focus on indium tin\noxide (ITO), our analytic results can be easily applied to any LEDD materials.",

In these experiments current heating is used\nto induce a controlled increase in the number of electron-electron collisions\nin the wire. The interplay between the partly diffusive wire-boundary\nscattering and the electron-electron scattering leads first to an increase and\nthen to a decrease of the resistance of the wire with increasing current. These\neffects are the electronic analog of Knudsen and Poiseuille flow in gas\ntransport, respectively. The electron flow is studied theoretically through a\nBoltzmann transport equation, which includes impurity, electron-electron, and\nboundary scattering. A solution is obtained for arbitrary scattering\nparameters. By calculation of flow profiles inside the wire it is demonstrated\nhow normal flow evolves into Poiseuille flow. The boundary-scattering\nparameters for the gate-defined wires can be deduced from the magnitude of the\nKnudsen effect. Good agreement between experiment and theory is obtained.",

In a two-dimensional noncentrosymmetric system, e.g. quantum well or\nheterojunction, the spin splitting is a linear function of ${\\bm k}$, at least\nfor small values of ${\\bm k}$. We demonstrate that the spin relaxation time\n$\\tau_s$ due to the spin splitting is controlled not only by momentum\nrelaxation processes as widely accepted but also by electron-electron\ncollisions which make no effect on the electron mobility. In order to calculate\nthe time $\\tau_s$ taking into account the electron-electron scattering we have\nsolved the two-dimensional kinetic equation for the electron spin density\nmatrix. We show how the theory can be extended to allow for degenerate\ndistribution of the spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gas.",

    "summary": "The electronic self-energy is studied for a two dimensional electron gas\ncoupled to a spin-orbit Rashba field and interacting with dispersionless\nphonons. For the case of a momentum independent electron-phonon coupling\n(Holstein model) we solve numerically the self-consistent non-crossing\napproximation for the self-energy and calculate the electron mass enhancement\n$m^*/m$ and the spectral properties. We find that, even for nominal weak\nelectron-phonon interaction, for strong spin-orbit couplings the electrons\nbehave as effectively strongly coupled to the phonons. We interpret this result\nby a topological change of the Fermi surface occurring at sufficiently strong\nspin-orbit coupling, which induces a square-root divergence in the electronic\ndensity of states at low energies. We provide results for $m^*/m$ and for the\ndensity of states of the interacting electrons for several values of the\nelectron filling and of the spin-orbit interaction.",

The influence of the electron-electron interactions and the\ncoupling to a dissipative bosonic bath on the electron transfer is studied in\ndifferent temperature regimes. At high temperatures Marcus transfer rates are\nevaluated and at low temperatures, we calculate equilibrium and non-equilibrium\npopulation probabilities of the donor and acceptor with the non-perturbative\nNumerical Renormalization Group approach. We obtain the non-equilibrium\ndynamics of the system prepared in an initial state of two electrons at the\ndonor site and identify conditions under which the electron transfer involves\none concerted two-electron step or two sequential single-electron steps. The\nrates of the sequential transfer depend non-monotonically on the difference\nbetween the inter-site and on-site Coulomb interaction which become\nrenormalized in the presence of the bosonic bath. If this difference is much\nlarger than the hopping matrix element, the temperature as well as the\nreorganization energy, simultaneous transfer of both electrons between donor\nand acceptor can be observed.",

    "summary": "Based on the recently proposed band model, the electronic specific heat of\nmoderately heavy electron compound YbAl$_3$ are investigated. The band term of\nthe Hamiltonian consists of three parts; conduction electrons described by the\nnearly free electron method, localized 4f electrons of Yb ions and the\nhybridization term between these electrons. Extracting several bands near the\nFermi level, we reconstruct the low-energy effective Hamiltonian in order to\nconsider the correlation effect, which is studied by using the self-consistent\nsecond order perturbation theory combined with local approximation. The\ntemperature dependence of the specific heat $c_{\\rm v}(T)$ is calculated as a\nfunction of temperature $T$ from the numerical derivative of the internal\nenergy. Sommerfeld coefficient $\\gamma$ is also calculated from the direct\nformula. The overall structure of $c_{\\rm v}(T)/T$ is in quantitative agreement\nwith the experimental results, which have the characteristic two-peak\nstructures. They originate from the correlation effect and the structure of the\nnon-interacting density of states, respectively. We show that our effective\nHamiltonian yielding the realistic band structure may describe quantitatively\nheavy electron compounds with conduction bands composed of s- or p- electrons.",

    "summary": "Using a model of particle acceleration and transport in solar flares, we\ninvestigate the height distribution of coronal electrons by focusing on the\nenergy-dependent pitch-angle scattering. When pitch-angle scattering is not\nincluded, the peak heights of loop-top electrons are constant, regardless of\ntheir energy, owing to the continuous acceleration and compression of the\nelectrons via shrinkage of magnetic loops. On the other hand, under pitch-angle\nscattering, the electron heights are energy dependent; intermediate energy\nelectrons are at a higher altitude, whereas lower and higher energy electrons\nare at lower altitudes. This implies that the intermediate energy electrons are\ninhibited to follow the shrinking field lines to lower altitudes because\npitch-angle scattering causes efficient precipitation of these electrons into\nthe footpoint and their subsequent loss from the loop. This result is\nqualitatively consistent with the position of the above-the-loop-top hard X-ray\n(HXR) source that is located above coronal HXR loops emitted by lower energy\nelectrons and microwaves emitted by higher energy electrons. Quantitative\nagreement with observations might be achieved by considering primary\nacceleration before the onset of loop shrinkage and additional pitch-angle\nscattering via wave-particle interactions.",

We develop an exact numerical method for treating the\nscattering problem within the stationary two-electron wave function picture.\nThe considered process conserves the total energy but the electron within the\nwire passes a part of its energy to the ring. We demonstrate that the inelastic\nscattering results in both magnetic asymmetry of the transfer probability and a\nturnstile action of the ring on the electrons traveling separately along the\nring. We demonstrate that the inelastic backscattering and / or inelastic\nelectron transfer can be selectively eliminated from the process by inclusion\nof an energy filter into the wire in form of a double barrier system with the\nresonant energy level tuned to the energy of the incident electron. We\ndemonstrate that the magnetic symmetry is restored when the inelastic\nbackscattering is switched o?, and the turnstile character of the ring is\nremoved when the energy transfer to the ring is excluded for both transferred\nand backscattered electron waves.

The spin polarization\n$P$ can be very close to unity and the electron current passing through the\ntunnel contact splits in the waveguide into two branches flowing from the\ncontact. The polarization essentially depends on the electron scattering by the\ncontact and the electron-electron interaction in the one-dimensional edge\nstates. The electron-electron interaction is treated within the Luttinger\nliquid model. The main effect of the interaction stems from the renormalization\nof the electron velocity, due to which the polarization increases with the\ninteraction strength. Electron scattering by the contact leads to a decrease in\n$P$. A specific effect occurs when the bottom of the subbands in the waveguide\ncrosses the Dirac point of the spectrum of edge states when changing the\nvoltage or chemical potential. This leads to changing the direction of the spin\ncurrent.",

At the parallel or perpendicular propagation of the longitudinal\nwaves in electron-positron-ion plasmas we find four branches: the Langmuir\nwave, the positron-acoustic wave and pair of waves having spin nature, they are\nthe SEAW and, as we called it, spin-electron-positron acoustic wave (SEPAW). At\nthe oblique propagation we find eight longitudinal waves: the Langmuir wave,\nTrivelpiece-Gould wave, pair of positron-acoustic waves, pair of SEAWs, and\npair of SEPAWs. Thus, for the first time, we report existence of the second\npositron-acoustic wave existing at the oblique propagation and existence of\nSEPAWs.",

    "summary": "The course of non-thermal electron ejection in relativistic unmagnetized\nelectron-ion shocks is investigated by performing self-consistent\nparticle-in-cell simulations. The shocks are excited through the injection of\nrelativistic jet into ambient plasma, leading to two distinct shocks (named as\nthe trailing shock and leading shock) and a contact discontinuity. The\nWeibel-like instabilities heat the electrons up to approximately half of ion\nkinetic energy. The double layers formed in the trailing and leading edges then\naccelerated the electrons by the ion kinetic energy. The electron distribution\nfunction in the leading edge shows a clear non-thermal power-law tail which\ncontains $\\sim1\\%$ of electrons and $\\sim8\\%$ of electron energy. Its power-law\nindex is -2.6. The acceleration efficiency is $\\sim23\\%$ by number and\n$\\sim50\\%$ by energy and the power-law index is -1.8 for electron distribution\nfunction in the trailing edge. The effect of the dimensionality is examined by\ncomparing results of 3D simulation with 2D ones. It exhibits that the electron\nacceleration is more efficient in 2D.",

    "title": "Photoinduced vibronic coupling in two-level dissipative systems",
    "summary": "Interaction of an electron system with a strong electromagnetic wave leads to\nrearrangement both the electron and vibrational energy spectra of a dissipative\nsystem. For instance, the optically coupled electron levels become split in the\nconditions of the ac Stark effect that gives rise to appearance of the\nnonadiabatic coupling between the electron and vibrational motions. The\nnonadiabatic coupling exerts a substantial impact on the electron and phonon\ndynamics and must be taken into account to determine the system wave functions.\nIn this paper, the vibronic coupling induced by the ac Stark effect is\nconsidered. It is shown that the interaction between the electron states\ndressed by an electromagnetic field and the forced vibrations of reservoir\noscillators under the action of rapid changing of the electron density with the\nRabi frequency is responsible for establishment of the photoinduced vibronic\ncoupling. However, if the resonance conditions for the optical phonon frequency\nand the transition frequency of electrons in the dressed state basis are\nsatisfied, the vibronic coupling is due to the electron-phonon interaction.\nAdditionally, photoinduced vibronic coupling results in appearance of the\ndoubly dressed states which are formed by both the electron-photon and\nelectron-vibrational interactions.",

    "summary": "Currently, molecular tunnel junctions are recognized as important active\nelements of various nanodevices. This gives a strong motivation to study\nphysical mechanisms controlling electron transport through molecules. Electron\nmotion through a molecular bridge is always somewhat affected by the\nenvironment, and the interactions with the invironment could change the energy\nof the traveling electron. Under certain conditions these inelastic effects may\nsignificantly modify electron transport characteristics. In the present work we\ndescribe inelastic and dissipative effects in the electron transport occurring\ndue to the molecular bridge vibrations and stochastic thermally activated ion\nmotions. We intentionally use simple models and computational techniques to\nkeep a reader focused on the physics of inelastic electron transport in\nmolecular tunnel junctions. We consider electron-vibron interactions and their\nmanifestations in the inelastic tunneling spectra, polaronic effects and\ndissipative electron transport. Also, we briefly discuss long-range electron\ntransfer reactions in macromolecules and their relation to the electron\ntransport through molecular junctions.",

    "summary": "Seventy crossings of the Earths bow shock by the THEMIS satellites have been\nused to study thermal electron heating in collisionless, quasi-perpendicular\nshocks. It was found that the temperature increase of thermal electrons\ndiffered from the magnetic field increase by factors as great as three, that\nthe parallel electron temperature increase was not produced by parallel\nelectric fields, and that the parallel and perpendicular electron temperature\nincreases were the same on the average. It was also found that the\nperpendicular and parallel electron heating occurred simultaneously so that the\nisotropization time is the same as the heating time. These results cannot be\nexplained by energy transfer from waves to electrons or by the motion of\nmagnetized electrons through the shock. Electric field fluctuations on the\nscale of the electron gyro-diameter were found to be of finite amplitude in the\nshock ramp, which requires that the electron trajectories be more random and\nchaotic than orderly and adiabatic. The data may be explained by the large\namplitude electric field fluctuations that demagnetize electrons as they move\nthrough the cross-shock electric field",

It is found\nthat the resistivity caused by the thermal phonons obeys Bloch-Gr\\\"{u}neisen\nlaw from $\\sim$90 to 300\\,K, while only the diffusive thermopower, which varies\nlinearly with temperature from 300 down to 10\\,K, can be observed.The\nphonon-drag thermopower is completely suppressed due to the long\nelectron-phonon relaxation time in the compound. These observations, together\nwith the temperature independent characteristic of carrier concentration,\nindicate that the conduction electron in F-doped SnO$_2$ films behaves\nessentially like a free electron. At low temperatures, the electron-electron\nscattering dominates over the electron-phonon scattering and governs the\ninelastic scattering process. The theoretical predicated scattering rates for\nboth large- and small-energy-transfer electron-electron scattering processes,\nwhich are negligibly weak in three-dimensional disordered conventional\nconductors, are quantitatively tested in this lower carrier concentration and\nfree-electron-like highly degenerate semiconductor.",

    "summary": "In clean Dirac electron systems such as graphene, electron-electron\ninteractions can dominate over other relaxation mechanisms such as phonon or\nimpurity scattering. It has been predicted that in this limit, collective\nelectron dynamics can be described by hydrodynamic equations. The prerequisites\nfor electron liquids are already fulfilled in current experiments and hints of\nelectron hydrodynamics have been identified in transport measurements. Here, we\nshow that a nozzle geometry, implemented for example in a graphene sample, can\ncause a transition from subsonic to supersonic flow and provides an interesting\nprobe for the hydrodynamic regime of Dirac electrons. In particular, we predict\ntwo distinct transport features that can be seen in the experimentally\nmeasurable voltage characteristics on the exit side of the nozzle: a pronounced\nnegative local resistance, and an abrupt change of the electrostatic potential\ninduced by an electron shock wave. Our results pave the way for an experimental\nidentification of supersonic hydrodynamic electron flow and for the\nexperimental study of electron shock waves.",

    "summary": "Single electrons can be conceived as the simplest quantum nodes in a quantum\nnetwork. Between electrons, single photons can act as quantum channels to\nexchange quantum information. Despite this appealing picture, in conventional\nmaterials, it is extremely difficult to make individual electrons and photons\ncoherently interact with each other at the visible-infrared wavelengths\nsuitable for long-distance communication. Here we theoretically demonstrate\nthat the self-confined single-electron structure in condensed helium-4 can be a\nfascinating candidate for single-electron quantum nodes. Each electron in\nhelium forms a bubble of 1 to 2 nm radius and coherently interacts with\nmid-infrared photons. A parametrically amplified femtosecond laser can drive\nthe electrons into any superposition between the ground and excited states. An\nelectron inside a slot-waveguide cavity can strongly couple with cavity photons\nand exhibits vacuum Rabi oscillations. Two electrons in the cavity naturally\ngenerate entanglement through their respective coupling to the lossy cavity.\nThe electron-in-helium system offers unique insight in understanding\nnonequilibrium quantum dynamics.",

    "summary": "Atomic motion dynamics during structural changes or chemical reactions have\nbeen visualized by picosecond and femtosecond pulsed electron beams via\nultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy. Imaging the even faster dynamics\nof electrons in atoms, molecules and solids requires electron pulses with\nsub-femtosecond durations. We demonstrate here the all-optical generation of\ntrains of attosecond free-electron pulses. The concept is based on the periodic\nenergy modulation of a pulsed electron beam via an inelastic interaction with\nthe ponderomotive potential of an optical travelling wave generated by two\nfemtosecond laser pulses at different frequencies in vacuum. The subsequent\ndispersive propagation leads to a compression of the electrons and the\nformation of ultrashort pulses. The longitudinal phase space evolution of the\nelectrons after compression is mapped by a second phase-locked interaction. The\ncomparison of measured and calculated spectrograms reveals the attosecond\ntemporal structure of the compressed electron pulse trains with individual\npulse durations of less than 300 as. This technique can be utilized for\ntailoring and initial characterization of sub-optical cycle free-electron\npulses at high repetition rates for stroboscopic time-resolved experiments with\nsub-femtosecond time resolution.",

We show that the EEI effect is primarily\nresponsible for an increase in the Hall coefficient in the La-doped SrSnO3\nfilms below 50 K accompanied by an increase in the sheet resistance. The\nquantitative analysis of the magnetoresistance (MR) data yielded a large phase\ncoherence length of electrons exceeding 450 nm at 1.8 K and revealed the\nelectron-electron interaction being accountable for breaking of electron phase\ncoherency in La-doped SrSnO3 films.

An electron beam produced by the emission interacts with the\nnonuniform plasma in the discharge via a two-stream instability. Efficient\nenergy transfer from the beam to the plasma electrons is ensured by the plasma\nnonuniformity. The electron beam excites plasma waves whose wavelength and\nphase speed gradually decrease towards anode. The short waves near the anode\naccelerate plasma bulk electrons to suprathermal energies. The sheath near the\nanode reflects some of the accelerated electrons back into the plasma. These\nelectrons travel through the plasma, reflect near the cathode, and enter the\naccelerating area again but with a higher energy than before. Such particles\nare accelerated to energies much higher than after the first acceleration. This\nmechanism plays a role in explaining earlier experimental observations of\nenergetic suprathermal electrons in similar discharges.",

The possibility of producing this electron\nsource is demonstrated using Particle-In-Cell simulations.

This behavior is in\nqualitative agreement with Landau's theory of Fermi liquids but the data show\ndeviations from the behavior of a common 3D degenerate electron gas. Concerning\nelectron-phonon interaction, our data allows us to directly observe the\ncoupling of individual Bloch state to the coherent $A_{1g}$ mode.

    "summary": "The electron--electron scattering does not affect the electrical current in\nGalilean--invariant systems. We show that nevertheless electron--electron\ncollisions may contribute to the electric resistivity of systems with parabolic\nspectrum provided that they have multiply connected Fermi surface and there is\nan additional mechanism of scattering. To this end, we calculate the\nresistivity of a two-dimensional electron gas with two filled transverse\nsubbands in a presence of electron--electron and impurity scattering. Though\nthe collisions between the electrons do not directly affect the current in such\nsystems, they cause a redistribution of the electrons between the Fermi\ncontours, which results in a noticeable change of resistivity for realistic\nmechanisms of impurity scattering.",

    "summary": "The transverse coherence of electrons is of utmost importance in high\nresolution electron microscopes, point-projection microscopes, low-energy\nelectron microscopy and various other applications. Pulsed versions of many of\nthese have recently been realized, mostly relying on femtosecond\nlaser-triggering electron emission from a sharp needle source. We here observe\nelectron interference fringes and measure how the interference visibility\nbecomes reduced as we increase the electron bunch charge. Due to the extremely\nstrong spatio-temporal confinement of the electrons generated here, we observe\nthe visibility reduction already at average electron bunch charges of less than\n1 electron per pulse, owing to the stochastic nature of the emission process.\nWe can fully and quantitatively explain the loss of coherence based on model\nsimulations. Via the van Cittert-Zernike theorem we can connect the visibility\nreduction to an increase of the effective source size. We conclude by\ndiscussing emittance, brightness and quantum degeneracy, which have direct\nramifications to many setups and devices relying on pulsed coherent electrons.",

    "summary": "The rate of energy transfer between electrons and phonons is investigated by\na first principles framework for electron temperatures up to $T_e=50000$ K\nwhile considering the lattice at ground state. Two typical but differently\ncomplex metals are investigated, namely Aluminium and Copper. In order to\nreasonably take the electronic excitation effect into account, we adopt finite\ntemperature density functional theory and linear response to determine the\nelectron-temperature-dependent Eliashberg function and electron density of\nstates. Of the three branch-dependent electron-phonon coupling strengths, the\nlongitudinal acoustic mode plays a dominant role in the electron-phonon\ncoupling for Aluminium for all temperatures considered here, but for Copper it\nonly dominates above an electron temperature of $T_e=40000$ K. The second\nmoment of the Eliashberg function and the electron phonon coupling constant at\nroom temperature $T_e=315$ K show good agreement with other results. For\nincreasing electron temperatures, we show the limits of the $T=0$ approximation\nfor the Eliashberg function. Our present work provides a rich perspective on\nthe phonon dynamics and this will help to improve insight into the underlying\nmechanism of energy flow in ultra-fast laser-metal interaction.",

We have found that while the electron-phonon dephasing rate increases\nwith the number of electrons confined in the unbiased case, this does not hold\nin the biased case. We define a merit figure as a ratio between the exchange\nenergy and the dephasing rate, and have shown that in experimentally relevant\nrange of the exchange energy, the merit figure actually increases with the\nnumber of electrons in the biased case.

We find that electron-phonon and electron-electron pairing are\ncooperative in a crossover region, where the two pairing mechanisms are of\ncomparable strength and where the filling is close to a van Hove singularity.\nIn particular, at the $p$-type van Hove filling the two pairing mechanisms are\ncooperative in the $E_{1u}$ ($p$-wave) and $B_{2u}$ ($f_{y^3-3yx^2}$-wave)\nchannels, whereas at the $m$-type van Hove filling they are cooperative in the\n$E_{1u}$ channel, but weakly competitive in the $B_{2u}$ channel. Moreover, we\nshow that the electron-phonon interaction acquires a significant momentum\ndependence, due to the sublattice texture of the Fermi surfaces, which can\npromote non $s$-wave pairing. We present a detailed analysis of these pairing\npropensities and discuss implications for the vanadium-based kagome\nsuperconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$.",

    "summary": "DIII-D discharges that transition to H-mode solely with off-axis electron\ncyclotron heating (ECH) often exhibit strong off-axis peaking of electron\ntemperature profiles at the heating location. Electron heat transport\nproperties near these off-axis temperature peaks have been studied using\nmodulated ECH. The Fourier analyzed electron temperature data have been used to\ninfer electron thermal diffusivity. Comparisons with numerical solutions of the\ntime-dependent electron thermal equation find that the data are consistent with\na narrow region with electron diffusivity $\\chi_e$ an order of magnitude lower\nthan the average value across the plasma, suggesting an electron internal\ntransport barrier (ITB) near the ECH heating location. Detailed profile\nanalysis and equilibrium reconstructions suggest that the formation of these\nITBs are correlated with off-axis values of the safety factor $q$ being near 1.\nFurthermore, the ECH driven H-mode discharges demonstrate more rapid electron\nheating rate near the ECH deposition location than L-mode discharges with\nhigher auxiliary ECH heating power. Additional modeling attributes this\ndifference to the modification of electron heat transport in the core at the\nL-H transition, which also sustains the off-axis electron temperature peaks.",

The system consists of\na heterostructure that has non-zero nuclei spins. We show that in this system\nelectrons can be confined into a dot region through a local nuclear spin\npolarization. The nuclear-spin-polarization-induced quantum dot has interesting\nproperties indicating that electron energy levels are time-dependent because of\nthe nuclear spin relaxation and diffusion processes. Electron confining\npotential is a solution of diffusion equation with relaxation. Experimental\ninvestigations of the time-dependence of electron energy levels will result in\nmore information about nuclear spin interactions in solids.",

We demonstrate\nthat an electron beam sweeping past an aperture creates a pumping effect,\nattracting carriers from this aperture. This pumping effect originates from the\nspecific electric potential distribution induced by the injected electrons. In\nthe regions nearby the main stream of injected electrons, a positive potential\nis induced by the injected electrons. Thus, the normally repulsive Coulomb\ninteraction leads to an attractive force in the Fermi system. This quantum\npumping mechanism in a Fermi system differs qualitatively from the Bernoulli\npumping effect in classical liquids. We also discuss possible experimental\nrealizations.",

From the analysis of a three-level\natomic system containing two electrons, and driven by the two laser fields\nneeded for coherent population trapping, a conceptually new kind of\ntwo-electron dark state appears.

    "summary": "We report experimental results of the effect of Ka-band microwave on the spin\ndynamics of electrons in a 2D electron system in a GaAs/Al0.35Ga0.65As\nheterostructure, via time-resolved Kerr rotation measurements. While the\nmicrowave reduces the transverse spin lifetime of the bulk GaAs when its\nfrequency is close to the Zeeman splitting of the electrons in the magnetic\nfield, it significantly increases that of electrons in the 2D electron system,\nfrom 745 ps to 1213 ps. Such a microwave-enhanced spin lifetime is ascribed to\nthe microwave-induced electron scattering which leads to a motional narrowing\nof spins via DP mechanism.",

    "summary": "Electronic correlation is a fundamental topic in many-electron systems. To\ncharacterize this correlation, one may introduce the concept of\nexchange-correlation hole. In this paper, we first briefly revisit its\ndefinition and relation to electron and geminal densities, followed by their\nintimate relations to copula functions in probability theory and statistics. We\nthen propose a copula-based approach to estimate the exchange-correlation hole\nfrom the electron density.

To use\nelectron spins as qubits, a crucial condition is the isolation of the electron\nspins from their environment, including the electronic orbital degrees of\nfreedom. We provide detailed electronic structure calculations of both the\nsingle donor electron wave function and the two-electron pair wave function. We\nadopted a molecular orbital method for the two-electron problem, forming a\nbasis with the calculated single donor electron orbitals. Our two-electron\nbasis contains many singlet and triplet orbital excited states, in addition to\nthe two simple ground state singlet and triplet orbitals usually used in the\nHeitler-London approximation to describe the two-electron donor pair wave\nfunction. We determined the excitation spectrum of the two-donor system, and\nstudy its dependence on strain, lattice position and inter donor separation.\nThis allows us to determine how isolated the ground state singlet and triplet\norbitals are from the rest of the excited state Hilbert space. In addition to\ncalculating the energy spectrum, we are also able to evaluate the exchange\ncoupling between the two donor electrons, and the double occupancy probability\nthat both electrons will reside on the same P donor. These two quantities are\nvery important for logical operations in solid-state quantum computing devices,\nas a large exchange coupling achieves faster gating times, whilst the magnitude\nof the double occupancy probability can affect the error rate.",

The time-resolved electronic spectrum\nshows coherence-incoherence spectral weight transfer, a clear signature of\nlight-enhanced electron-phonon coupling. The present study is motivated by\nrecent evidence for enhanced electron-phonon coupling in pump-probe TeraHertz\nand angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in bilayer graphene when driven\nnear resonance with an infrared-active phonon mode [E.~Pomarico et al.,\nPhys.~Rev.~B 95, 024304 (2017)], and by a theoretical study suggesting that\ntransient electronic attraction arises from nonlinear electron-phonon coupling\n[D.~M.~Kennes et al., Nature Physics (2017), 10.1038/nphys4024]. We show that a\nlinear scaling of light-enhanced electron-phonon coupling with the pump field\nintensity emerges, in accordance with a time-nonlocal self-energy based on a\nmean-field decoupling using quasi-classical phonon coherent states. Finally we\ndemonstrate that this leads to enhanced double occupancies in accordance with\nan effective electron-electron attraction.

We have calculated the vertical electron affinity\nvalues of first five electron attached states of the DNA and RNA nucleobases\nand only the first electron attached state is found to be energetically\naccessible in gas phase. An analysis of the natural orbitals shows that the\nfirst electron attached states of uracil and thymine are valence-bound type and\nundergo significant structural changes on attachment of excess electron, which\nis reflected in the deviation of the adiabatic electron affinity from the\nvertical one. On the other hand, the first electron attached state of cytosine,\nadenine and guanine are dipole-bound type and their structure remain unaffected\non attachment of an extra electron, which results in small deviation of\nadiabatic electron affinity from that of the vertical one. Vertical and\nadiabatic electron affinity values of all the DNA and RNA nucleobases are\nnegative implying that the first electron attached state are not stable, but\nrather resonance states. Previously, reported theoretical studies had shown\nscattered results for electron affinities of DNA and RNA bases, with large\ndeviations from experimental values.

    "summary": "Analogy between behavior of electrons in narrow-gap semiconductors (NGS) and\nrelativistic electrons is reviewed. Energy bands in NGS correspond to special\nrelativity, the latter is analogous to two-band k.p description for NGS.\nMaximum electron velocity in NGS is u=(okolo)1x 10^8 cm/s corresponding to the\nlight velocity. An effective mass of electrons in semiconductors is introduced\nrelating their velocity to quasimomentum. This mass depends on energy similarly\nto the mass of relativistic electrons. In Hg_(1-x)Cd_(x)Te alloys one can reach\nvanishing energy gap at which electrons and light holes are 3D massless Dirac\nfermions. Wavelength lam_z is defined for NGS, in analogy to the Compton\nwavelength, lam_z is around tens of Angstroms in semiconducting materials, in\nagreement with tunneling experiments. Interband electron tunneling in NGS is in\nclose analogy to tunneling between negative and positive energies of the Dirac\nequation. Relativistic analogy holds for orbital and spin properties of\nelectrons in an external magnetic field. The spin magnetic moment of both NGS\nelectrons and relativistic electrons approaches zero with increasing energy.\nElectrons in crossed electric and magnetic fields are described. It is the\nsemirelativistic two-band description that gives a correct account of\nexperiments in this situation. A transverse Doppler shift is observed in\ncrossed fields indicating that there exists a time dilatation between an\nelectron and an observer. Phenomenon of Zitterbewegung (ZB, trembling motion)\nfor semiconductor electrons follows an analogy to free relativistic electrons.\nGraphene, carbon nanotubes, topological insulators illustrate extreme\nsemirelativistic regime. Approximations and restrictions of the relativistic\nanalogy are emphasized. It is often easier to observe semirelativistic effects\nin semiconductors than relativistic effects in vacuum.",

Pushing the coherent control of free\nelectrons by light to unexplored timescales, below the attosecond, would enable\nunprecedented applications in light-assisted electron quantum circuits and\ndiagnostics at extremely small timescales, such as those governing\nintramolecular electronic motion and nuclear phenomena. We experimentally\ndemonstrate attosecond coherent manipulation of the electron wave function in a\ntransmission electron microscope, and show that it can be pushed down to the\nzeptosecond regime with existing technology. We make a relativistic pulsed\nelectron beam interact in free space with an appropriately synthesized\nsemi-infinite light field generated by two femtosecond laser pulses reflected\nat the surface of a mirror and delayed by fractions of the optical cycle. The\namplitude and phase of the resulting coherent oscillations of the electron\nstates in energymomentum space are mapped via momentum-resolved ultrafast\nelectron energy-loss spectroscopy. The experimental results are in full\nagreement with our theoretical framework for light-electron interaction, which\npredicts access to the zeptosecond timescale by combining semi-infinite X-ray\nfields with free electrons.",

We study the interplay of the underlying scattering\nmechanisms for the case of a noble metal with help of a set of complete\nBoltzmann collision integrals. We trace the transient electron distribution in\ncopper and its deviations from a Fermi-Dirac distribution due to the excitation\nwith an ultrashort laser pulse. We investigate the different stages of\nelectronic nonequilibrium after an excitation with an ultrashort laser-pulse of\n800 nm wavelength and 10 fs pulse duration. Our calculations show a strong\nnonequilibrium during and directly after the end of the laser pulse.\nSubsequently, we find a fast thermalization of most electrons. Surprisingly, we\nobserve a long-lasting nonequilibrium, which can be attributed to the\nelectron-phonon scattering. This nonequilibrium establishes at energies around\npeaks in the density of states of the electrons and persists on the timescale\nof electron-phonon energy relaxation.

To measure the\nelectron and positron beams, picking up of these two different bunches in real\ntime is of notable concern. Because the time interval between adjacent electron\nand positron bunches is quite small, for example, 6 ns in CEPC, high-speed\nswitch electronics is required. This paper presents the prototype design of a\nhigh-speed radio frequency (RF) electronics that can pick up nanosecond\npositron-electron beam bunches with a switching time of less than 6 ns. Fast\nseparation of electron and positron is achieved based on RF switches and\nprecise delay adjustment of the controlling signals (~10 ps). Initial tests\nhave been conducted in the laboratory to evaluate the performance of\nelectronics, the results indicate that this circuit can successfully pick up\nthe bunch signal within a time interval of 6 ns, which makes it possible to\nfurther measure the electron and position beams simultaneously.",

    "summary": "Atomically thin films of Pb on Si(111) provide an experimentally tunable\nsystem comprising a highly structured electronic density of states. The\nlifetime of excited electrons in these states is limited by both\nelectron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-ph) scattering. We employ the\ndescription by a master equation for the electronic occupation numbers to\nanalyze the relative importance of both scattering mechanisms. The electronic\nand phononic band structures, as well as the matrix elements for\nelectron-phonon coupling within deformation potential theory were obtained from\ndensity functional calculations, thus taking into account quantum confinement\neffects. For the relaxation dynamics, the contribution of impact ionization\nprocesses to the lifetime is estimated from the imaginary part of the\nelectronic self-energy calculated in the GW approximation. By numerically\nsolving rate equations for the occupations of the Pb-derived electronic states\ncoupled to a phononic heat bath, we are able to follow the distribution of the\nelectronic excitation energy to the various modes of Pb lattice vibrations.\nWhile e-e scattering is the dominant relaxation mechanism, we demonstrate that\nthe e-ph scattering is highly phonon-mode-specific, with a large contribution\nfrom surface phonons. At electron energies of about 0.3 eV above the Fermi\nsurface, a 'phonon bottleneck' characteristic of relaxation in nanostructures\nwith well-separated electronic states is observed. The time scales extracted\nfrom the simulations are compared to data from pump-probe experiments using\ntime-resolved two-photon photoemission.",

A\nfew recent experimental studies measured the value of the electronic thermal\nconductivity directly and some theoretical works have predicted the electronic\nthermal conductivity of iron at Earth's core conditions based on the\nKubo-Greenwood method. However, these results differ largely from each other. A\nvery recent research has confirmed that for iron at Earth's core conditions the\nstrength of electron-electron scattering could be comparable to that for\nelectron-phonon scattering, meaning that the electron-electron scattering\nshould also be considered when evaluating the electronic thermal conductivity\nin the Earth's core situations. Here, by utilizing a newly developed\nmethodology based on direct non-equilibrium $ab~initio$ molecular dynamics\nsimulation coupled with the concept of electrostatic potential oscillation, we\npredict the electronic thermal conductivity of iron in h.c.p phase. Our\nmethodology inherently includes the electron-phonon and electron-electron\ninteractions under extreme conditions. Our results are comparable to the\nprevious theoretical and experimental studies. More importantly, our\nmethodology provides a new physical picture to describe the heat transfer\nprocess in $\\epsilon-$iron at Earth's core conditions from the electrostatic\npotential oscillation point of view and offers a new approach to study thermal\ntransport property of pure metals in planet's cores with different temperature\nand pressures.",

    "title": "Photoinduced electron-electron pairing in the extended Falicov-Kimball\n  model",
    "summary": "By employing the time-dependent exact diagonalization method, we investigate\nthe photoexcited states of the excitonic insulator in the extended\nFalicov-Kimball model (EFKM). We here show that the pulse irradiation can\ninduce the interband electron-electron pair correlation in the photoexcited\nstates, while the excitonic electron-hole pair correlation in the initial\nground state is strongly suppressed. We also show that the photoexcited states\ncontains the eigenstates of the EFKM with a finite number of interband\nelectron-electron pairs, which are responsible for the enhancement of the\nelectron-electron pair correlation. The mechanism found here is due to the\npresence of the internal SU(2) pairing structure in the EFKM and thus it is\nessentially the same as that for the photoinduced $\\eta$-pairing in the\nrepulsive Hubbard model reported recently [T. Kaneko et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n${\\bf 122}$, 077002 (2019)]. This also explains why the nonlinear optical\nresponse is effective to induce the electron-electron pairs in the photoexcited\nstates of the EFKM. Furthermore, we show that, unlike the $\\eta$-pairing in the\nHubbard model, the internal SU(2) structure is preserved even for a\nnonbipartite lattice when the EFKM has the direct-type band structure, in which\nthe pulse irradiation can induce the electron-electron pair correlation with\nmomentum ${\\it {\\bf q}}$ = ${\\textbf 0}$ in the photoexcited states. We also\ndiscuss briefly the effect of a perturbation that breaks the internal SU(2)\nstructure.",

    "summary": "Electron-acoustic waves occur in space and laboratory plasmas where two\ndistinct electron populations exist, namely cool and hot electrons. The\nobservations revealed that the hot electron distribution often has a\nlong-tailed suprathermal (non-Maxwellian) form. The aim of the present study is\nto investigate how various plasma parameters modify the electron-acoustic\nstructures. We have studied the electron-acoustic waves in a collisionless and\nunmagnetized plasma consisting of cool inertial electrons, hot suprathermal\nelectrons, and mobile ions. First, we started with a cold one-fluid model, and\nwe extended it to a warm model, including the electron thermal pressure.\nFinally, the ion inertia was included in a two-fluid model. The linear\ndispersion relations for electron-acoustic waves depicted a strong dependence\nof the charge screening mechanism on excess suprathermality. A nonlinear\n(Sagdeev) pseudopotential technique was employed to investigate the existence\nof electron-acoustic solitary waves, and to determine how their characteristics\ndepend on various plasma parameters. The results indicate that the thermal\npressure deeply affects the electron-acoustic solitary waves. Only negative\npolarity waves were found to exist in the one-fluid model, which become\nnarrower as deviation from the Maxwellian increases, while the wave amplitude\nat fixed soliton speed increases. However, for a constant value of the true\nMach number, the amplitude decreases for increasing suprathermality. It is also\nfound that the ion inertia has a trivial role in the supersonic domain, but it\nis important to support positive polarity waves in the subsonic domain.",

On the other hand, quantum degenerate\nelectron beams do currently not exist. The realization of such beams may impact\nall electron beam technologies and are interesting to pursue. Past attempts to\nreach degeneracy were hampered by the low degeneracy of continuously emitting\nelectron sources. With the recent advent of ultra-short electron pulses, high\ndegeneracy is expected. Coulomb repulsion and low quantum coherence are hurdles\nthat need to be overcome. A quantum analysis of the electron degeneracy for\npartially coherent pulsed electron sources is presented. Two-particle\ncoincidence spectra are obtained for source parameters that are currently\navailable. The conclusive demonstration of the fermionic Hanbury-Brown Twiss\n(HBT) effect for free electrons is shown to be within reach, and our results\nsupport the claim that femto-second nanotip electron sources, both polarized\nand unpolarized, can manifest partial to complete quantum degeneracy with\nappreciable signal-to-noise-ratios for free electron pulses notwithstanding\ntheir small particle numbers.",

    "summary": "Highly energetic ions traversing a two-dimensional material such as graphene\nproduce strong electronic excitations. Electrons excited to energy states above\nthe work function can give rise to secondary electron emission, reducing the\namount of energy that remains the graphene after the ion impact. Electrons can\neither be emitted (kinetic energy transfer) or captured by the passing ion\n(potential energy transfer). To elucidate this behavior that is absent in\nthree-dimensional materials, we simulate the electron dynamics in graphene\nduring the first femtoseconds after ion impact. We employ two conceptually\ndifferent computational methods: a Monte Carlo (MC) based one, where electrons\nare treated as classical particles, and time-dependent density functional\ntheory (TDDFT), where electrons are described quantum-mechanically. We observe\nthat the linear dependence of electron emission on deposited energy, emerging\nfrom MC simulations, becomes sublinear and closer to the TDDFT values when the\nelectrostatic interactions of emitted electrons with graphene are taken into\naccount via complementary particle-in-cell simulations. Our TDDFT simulations\nshow that the probability for electron capture decreases rapidly with\nincreasing ion velocity, whereas secondary electron emission dominates in the\nhigh velocity regime. We estimate that these processes reduce the amount of\nenergy deposited in the graphene layer by 15\\,\\% to 65\\,\\%, depending on the\nion and its velocity. This finding clearly shows that electron emission must be\ntaken into consideration when modelling damage production in two-dimensional\nmaterials under ion irradiation.",

    "summary": "Semiconductor superlattices have been extensively investigated for\nthermoelectric applications, to explore the effects of compositions, interface\nstructures, and lattice strain environments on the reduction of thermal\nconductivity, and improvement of efficiency. Most studies assumed that their\nelectronic properties remain unaffected compared to their bulk counterparts.\nHowever, recent studies demonstrated that electronic properties of silicon\n(Si)/germanium (Ge) superlattices show significant variations depending on\ncompositions and growth substrates. These studies used a constant relaxation\ntime approximation, and ignored the effects of electron scattering processes.\nHere, we consider electron scattering with phonons and ionized impurities, and\nreport first-principles calculations of electronic transport properties\nincluding the scattering rates. We investigate two classes of Si/Ge\nsuperlattices: superlattices with varied compositions grown on identical\nsubstrates and with identical compositions but grown on different substrates.\nWe illustrate the relationship between the energy bands of the superlattices\nand the electron-phonon relaxation times. We model the electron-ionized\nimpurity interaction potentials by accounting for the in-plane and the\ncross-plane structural anisotropy. Our analysis reveals that the inclusion of\nelectron-phonon and electron-impurity scattering processes can lead to\n~1.56-fold improved peak power-factors, compared to that of bulk Si. We observe\nthat superlattices can also display dramatically reduced power-factors for\nspecific lattice strain environments. Such reduction could cancel out\nthermoelectric efficiency improvements due to reduced thermal conductivities.\nOur study provides insight to predict variation of electronic properties due to\nchanges in lattice strain environments, essential for designing superlattices\nwith optimized electronic properties.",

Here, we suggest relativistic\nhydrodynamics with the separate spin evolution which allows us to study linear\nand nonlinear spin-electron-acoustic waves, including the\nspin-electron-acoustic solitons. Presented hydrodynamic model is the\ncorresponding generalization of the relativistic hydrodynamic model with the\naverage reverse gamma factor evolution which consists of the equations for\nevolution of the following functions the partial concentrations (for spin-up\nelectrons and spin down electrons), the partial velocity fields, the partial\naverage reverse relativistic gamma factors, and the partial flux of the reverse\nrelativistic gamma factors. We find that the relativistic effects decreases the\nphase velocity of spin-electron-acoustic waves.

It is demonstrated that spectra of Langmuir wave and\nspin-electron-acoustic wave getting closer to each other in the relativistic\nlimit.

    "summary": "High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are exceptional candidates for radiation-resistant\nmaterials due to their complex local chemical environment and slow defect\nmigration. Despite commonly overlooked, electronic effects on defects evolution\nin radiation environments also play a crucial role by dissipating excess energy\nthrough electron-phonon coupling and electronic heat conduction during cascade\nevents. We present a systematic study on electronic properties in random-solid\nsolutions (RSS) in four and five principal elements HEAs and their effect on\ndefect formation, clustering, and recombination. Electronic properties,\nincluding electron-phonon coupling factor, the electronic specific heat, and\nthe electronic thermal conductivity, are computed within first-principles\ncalculations. Using the two-temperature molecular dynamics simulations, we show\nthat the electron-phonon coupling factor and electronic specific heat play a\ncritical role in Frenkel pairs formation. Specifically, the electron-phonon\ncoupling factor quickly dissipates the kinetic energy during primary knock-on\natom events via plasmon excitations and is subsequently dissipated via the\nfree-electrons conduction. We show that these effects are more critical than\nthe elastic distortion effects produced by the atomic mismatch. Of tremendous\ninterest, we show that including lighter elements helps to increase the\nelectron-phonon coupling factor, suggesting the possibility to improve\nradiation resistance in HEA through optimal composition.",

We do so in the context of triple ionization of strongly driven Ne.\nWe show that a drawback of other current quantum mechanical and classical\nmodels of triple ionization is that they soften the Coulomb potential of each\nelectron with the core. The model we employ fully accounts for the singularity\nin the Coulomb potentials of a recolliding electron with the core and a bound\nelectron with the core as well as for the interaction of a recolliding with a\nbound electron. Our model treats approximately only the interaction between\nbound electrons through the use of effective potentials. These effective\npotentials ensure that no artificial autoionization takes place as a result of\nthe full treatment of the electron-core potential. We demonstrate the accuracy\nof our model by obtaining triple ionization distributions of the sum of the\nfinal electron momenta which we find to be in very good agreement with\nexperiments. Also, we explain the main features of these momenta distributions\nin terms of the prevalent pathways of correlated three-electron escape in Ne.\nWe also show that the different ionization pathways prevailing in\nthree-electron escape in strongly driven Ne versus Ar give rise to different\nmomenta distributions in these two atoms.",

    "summary": "Electron capture times in a separate confinement quantum well (QW) structure\nwith finite electron density are calculated for electron-electron (e-e) and\nelectron-polar optic phonon (e-pop) scattering. We find that the capture time\noscillates as function of the QW width for both processes with the same period,\nbut with very different amplitudes. For an electron density of 10^11 cm^-2 the\ne-e capture time is 10-1000 times larger than the e-pop capture time except for\nQW widths near the resonance minima, where it is only 2-3 times larger. With\nincreasing electron density the e-e capture time decreases and near the\nresonance becomes smaller than the e-pop capture time. Our e-e capture time\nvalues are two-to-three orders of magnitude larger than previous results of\nBlom et al. [Appl. Phys. Lett. 62, 1490 (1993)]. The role of the e-e capture in\nQW lasers is therefore readdressed.",

The experimental data clearly demonstrate that the\ncontribution of electron-electron interaction to electron phase relaxation\nincreases with disorder and support the theoretical prediction that the\nfrequency of electron-phonon scattering tends to diminish upon a decrease in\nelectron mean free path. It is found that the spin-orbit scattering rate\ndecreases with disorder.

Specifically, we calculate the accumulated\ncharge on the dots as function of the gate voltage, for various strengths of\nthe electron-electron interaction and of the hybridization between the dots and\nthe (one-dimensional) leads. With increasing of the (negative) gate voltage,\nthe accumulated charge in the two-electron ground state increases in gradual\nsteps from 0 to 1 and then to 2. The value 0 represents an \"insulating\" state,\nwhere both electrons are bound to shallow states on the impurities. The value\nof 1 corresponds to a \"metal\", with one electron localized on the dots and the\nother extended on the leads. The value of 2 corresponds to another \"insulator\",\nwith both electrons strongly localized. The width of the \"metallic\" regime\ndiverges with strength of the electron-electron interaction for the single dot,\nbut remains very narrow for the double dot. These results are contrasted with\nthe simple Coulomb blockade picture.",

Familiar among these are the Mott\ninsulator, high-transition-temperature superconductor and metallic phases. A\nfourth phase, ofunknown identity, occurs at light doping along the\nzero-temperature bound of the `pseudogap' regime. This regime is rich in\npeculiar electronic phenomena, prompting numerous proposals that it contains\nsome form of hidden electronic order. Here we present low-temperature\nelectronic structure imaging studies of a lightly hole-doped copper oxide:\nCa_{2-x}Na_{x}CuO_{2}Cl_{2}. Tunnelling spectroscopy (at energies |E|&gt;100 meV)\nreveals electron extraction probabilities greatly exceeding those for\ninjection, as anticipated for a doped Mott insulator. However, for |E|&lt;100 meV,\nthe spectrum exhibits a V-shaped energy gap centred on E=0. States within this\ngap undergo intense spatial modulations, with the spatial correlations of a\nfour CuO_{2}-unit-cell square checkerboard, independent of energy. Intricate\natomic-scale electronic structure variations also exist within the\ncheckerboard. These data are consistent with an unanticipated crystalline\nelectronic state, possibly the hidden electronic order, existing in the\nzero-temperature pseudogap regime of Ca_{2-x}Na_{x}CuO_{2}Cl_{2}.",

    "summary": "The combination of density functional theory with other approaches to the\nmany-electron problem through the separation of the electron-electron\ninteraction into a short-range and a long-range contribution is a promising\nmethod, which is raising more and more interest in recent years. In this work\nsome properties of the corresponding correlation energy functionals are derived\nby studying the electron-electron coalescence condition for a modified\n(long-range-only) interaction. A general relation for the on-top (zero\nelectron-electron distance) pair density is derived, and its usefulness is\ndiscussed with some examples. For the special case of the uniform electron gas,\na simple parameterization of the on-top pair density for a long-range only\ninteraction is presented and supported by calculations within the ``extended\nOverhauser model''. The results of this work can be used to build\nself-interaction corrected short-range correlation energy functionals.",

A new\nmethod which allows to determine the electron-electron interaction constant\n$\\lambda_c$ from the analysis of quantum correction to the magnetic\nsusceptibility and the magnetoresistance was developed. Three types of carbon\nmaterials: arc-produced multiwalled carbon nanotubes (arc-MWNTs), CVD-produced\ncatalytic multiwalled carbon nanotubes (c-MWNTs) and pyrolytic carbon were used\nfor investigation. We found that $\\lambda_c$=0.2 for arc-MWNTs (before and\nafter bromination treatment); $\\lambda_c$ = 0.1 for pyrolytic graphite;\n$\\lambda_c &gt;$ 0 for c-MWNTs. We conclude that the curvature of graphene layers\nin carbon nanostructures leads to the increase of the electron-electron\ninteraction constant $\\lambda_c$.",

    "title": "Relativistic mechanism of superconductivity",
    "summary": "According to the theory of relativity, the relativistic Coulomb's force\nbetween an electron pair is composed of two parts, the main part is repulsive,\nwhile the rest part can be attractive in certain situations. Thus the\nrelativistic attraction of an electron pair provides an insight into the\nmechanism of superconductivity. In superconductor, there are, probably at\nleast, two kinds of collective motions which can eliminate the repulsion\nbetween two electrons and let the attraction being dominant, the first is the\ncombination of lattice and electron gas, accounting for traditional\nsuperconductivity; the second is the electron gas themselves, accounting for\nhigh $T_c$ superconductivity. In usual materials, there is a good balance\nbetween the repulsion and attraction of an electron pair, the electrons are\nregarded as free electrons so that Fermi gas theory plays very well. But in\nsome materials, when the repulsion dominates electron pairs, the electron gas\nwill has a behavior opposite to superconductivity. In the present paper the\nsuperconducting states are discussed in terms of relativistic quantum theory in\ndetails, some significant results are obtained including quantized magnetic\nflux, London equation, Meissner effect and Josephson effect.",

The asymptotic solutions of\nthe proper two-electron Schrodinger equation have been derived for both\nelectron-nucleus and electron-electron coalescence. It is shown that the\nsolutions for the electron-nucleus coalescence correspond to the ground and\nsingly excited bound states, including triplet ones. The proper solutions at\nsmall distances $R$ from the triple coalescence point were presented as the\nsecond order expansion on R and lnR. The vanishing of the Fock's logarithmic\nterms at the electron-nucleus coalescence line was revealed in the frame of\nthis expansion, unlike the case of electron-electron coalescence. On the basis\nof the obtained boundary solutions the approximate wave function corresponding\nto both coalescence lines have been proposed in the two-exponential form with\nno variational parameters.",

Imaging flow in open systems is made possible by a cooled\nscanning probe microscope. Remarkable agreement between experiment and theory\ndemonstrates our ability to see these trajectories and to use this system as an\ninterferometer.

This technique can visualize the motion of electron waves\nbetween two points in an open system, providing a straightforward way to study\nsystems that may be useful for quantum information processing and spintronics.",

Using various perturbative and non-perturbative approximation schemes\nin order to establish the general shape of the electron spin susceptibility as\nfunction of its wave vector, we show that the nuclear spins locally order\nferromagnetically, and that this ordering can become global in certain regimes\nof interest.

    "summary": "Superconductivity develops from an attractive interaction between itinerant\nelectrons that creates electron pairs which condense into a macroscopic quantum\nstate--the superconducting state. On the other hand, magnetic order in a metal\narises from electrons localized close to the ionic core and whose interaction\nis mediated by itinerant electrons. The dichotomy between local moment magnetic\norder and superconductivity raises the question of whether these two states can\ncoexist and involve the same electrons. Here we show that the single\n4f-electron of cerium in CeRhIn5 simultaneously produces magnetism,\ncharacteristic of localization, and superconductivity that requires itinerancy.\nThe dual nature of the 4f-electron allows microscopic coexistence of\nantiferromagnetic order and superconductivity whose competition is tuned by\nsmall changes in pressure and magnetic field. Electronic duality contrasts with\nconventional interpretations of coexisting spin-density magnetism and\nsuperconductivity and offers a new avenue for understanding complex states in\nclasses of materials.",

In simple metal clusters, the\nvalence electrons determine stability and shape of the clusters. The ionic\nskeleton of alkali metals is soft, and cluster geometries are often solely\ndetermined by electron correlations. In quantum dots and rings, the electrons\nmay be confined by an external electrostatic potential, formed by a gated\nheterostructure. In the low density limit, the electrons may form so-called\nWigner molecules, for which the many-body quantum spectra reveal the classical\nvibration modes. High rotational states increase the tendency for the electrons\nto localize. At low angular momenta, the electrons may form a quantum Hall\nliquid with vortices. In this case, the vortices act as quasi-particles with\nlong-range effective interactions that localize in a vortex molecule, in much\nanalogy to the electron localization at strong rotation.",

All electrons move with uniform\nvelocity under an angle to the normal direction of the plane; such electron\nmotion corresponds to laser acceleration by direct action of the laser fields,\nas it is described in a companion paper. Electron density is chosen high enough\nto ensure that many electrons reside in a volume \\lambda_R^3, where \\lambda_R\nis the wavelength of the reflected light in the rest frame of the layer. Under\nthese conditions, the probe light is back-scattered coherently and is directed\nclose to the layer normal rather than the direction of electron velocity. An\nimportant consequence is that the Doppler shift is governed by\n\\gamma_x=(1-(V_x/c)^2)^{-1/2} derived from the electron velocity component V_x\nin normal direction rather than the full \\gamma-factor of the layer electrons.",

    "summary": "In the usual description of electrons in metals and superconductors, the\nsingle electron states are assumed to satisfy Bloch's theorem. This is because\nthe electron-ion interaction is privileged over the electron-electron\ninteraction. However the theory of hole superconductivity proposes that in the\ntransition to superconductivity carriers `undress' from the electron-ion\ninteraction. I propose here a new basis set to describe electrons in the\nsuperconducting state that does not satisfy Bloch's theorem but instead is\ndesigned to optimize the electron-electron interaction. The new basis set\nfavors a superconducting state where a spin current exists and where states\nnear the bottom of the band become partially occupied, as predicted by the\ntheory of hole superconductivity.",

We\nshow that the shapes of the electron momentum distributions carry information\nabout the bound-state with which the first electron collides, the bound state\nto which the second electron is excited, and the type of electron-electron\ninteraction. Furthermore, one may define a driving-field intensity threshold\nfor the RESI physical mechanism. At the threshold, the kinetic energy of the\nfirst electron, upon return, is just sufficient to excite the second electron.\nWe compute the distributions for helium and argon in the threshold and\nabove-threshold intensity regime. In the latter case, we relate our findings to\nexisting experiments.

As a result, a strong domination of\nresonant polaron-assisted electron transport at low temperatures has been\nfound. Additional narrowing due to electron-electron interaction in the leads,\nis roughly the same for all polaron-assisted resonances.",

The influence of interactions is qualitatively weaker\nthan in the comparable cases of single-layer graphene or topological\ninsulators, because the momentum-space layer pseudospin vorticity is 2 rather\nthan 1. Our study relies on the quantum Liouville equation in the first Born\napproximation with respect to the scattering potential, with electron-electron\ninteractions taken into account self-consistently in the Hartree-Fock\napproximation and screening in the random phase approximation.

Using the developed formalism we compute the phonon-induced spin\nlifetimes of hot electrons in Fe, Co, and Ni.

The widely used two temperature model\nfollows from the theory as the limiting case, when the thermalization due to\nthe electronelectron collisions is fast with respect to the electron-phonon\nrelaxation. It is demonstrated that the energy relaxation has two consecutive\nprocesses. The first and most important step describes the emission of phonons\nby the photo-excited electrons. It leads to the relaxation of 90% of the energy\nbefore the electrons become thermalized among themselves. The second step\ndescribes electronphonon thermalization and may be described by the two\ntemperature model. The second stage is difficult to observe experimentally\nbecause it involves the transfer of only a small amount of energy from\nelectrons. Thus the theory explains why the divergence of the relaxation time\nat low temperatures was never observed experimentally.",

    "summary": "Pairing of particles, in particular electrons, in high temperature plasma is\ngenerally not expected to occur. Here we investigate, based on earlier work,\nthe possibility for electron pairing mediated in the presence of various kinds\nof plasma waves. We confirm the possibility for pairing in ion- and\nelectron-acoustic waves, pointing out the importance of the former and the\nexpected consequences. While electron-acoustic waves probably do not play any\nrole, ion-acoustic waves may cause formation of heavy electron compounds. Lower\nhybrid waves also mediate pairing but under different conditions. Buneman modes\nwhich evolve from strong currents may cause pairing among trapped electrons\nconstituting a heavy electron component that populates electron holes. All\npairing processes are found to generate cold pair populations. They provide a\nmechanism of electron cooling which can be interpreted as kind of classical\ncondensation, in some cases possibly accompanied by formation of current\nfilaments, weak soft-X-ray emission and superfluidity which might affect\nreconnection physics.",

    "summary": "By introducing concepts of beam shaping into quantum mechanics, we show how\ninterference effects of the quantum wavefunction describing multiple electrons\ncan exactly balance the repulsion among the electrons. With proper shaping of\nthe fermionic wavefunction, we propose non-diffracting quantum wavepackets of\nmultiple electrons that can also carry orbital angular momentum, in the form of\nmulti-electron non-diffracting vortex beams. The wavefunction is designed to\ncompensate for both the repulsion between electrons and for the\ndiffraction-broadening. This wavefunction shaping facilitates the use of\nelectron beams of higher current in numerous applications, thereby improving\nthe signal-to-noise-ratio in electron microscopy and related systems without\ncompromising on the spatial resolution. Our scheme potentially applies for any\nbeams of charged particles, such as protons, muons and ion beams.",

    "summary": "Here a new microscopic method is proposed to image and characterize very thin\nsamples like few-layer materials, organic molecules, and nanostructures with\nnanometer or sub-nanometer resolution using electron beams of energies lower\nthan 20 eV. The microscopic technique achieves high resolution through the\nproximity (or near-field) effect, as in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM),\nwhile it also allows detection of transmitted electrons for imaging and\nspectroscopy, as in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). This\nproximity transmission electron microscopy (PSTEM) does not require any lens to\nfocus the electron beam. It also allows detailed characterization of the\ninteraction of low-energy electron with materials. PSTEM can operate in a way\nvery similar to scanning tunneling microscopy, which provides high-resolution\nimaging of geometric and electronic structures of the sample surface. In\naddition, it allows imaging and characterization of the interior structures of\nthe sample based on the detected transmission electron signals. PSTEM comprises\na family of spectroscopies that address the transport and scattering of\nlow-energy electrons in materials. Thus rich information can be extracted from\nthe measurements. PSTEM offers a fundamentally new and powerful way to\ninvestigate thin materials. New analysis methods of thin materials and new\nphysics may be uncovered by this method.",

It\nhas the d1 electron configuration and is an ideal model compound to study\nelectron correlation effects in normal metal. ARPES studies of bulk\nsingle-crystal SrVO3 and CaVO3 have revealed the difference in the mass\nrenormalization of electrons between them. In-situ ARPES studies of thin films\nfabricated by the pulsed laser deposition method have clarified not only\nquasi-particle dispersions, which show a kink like high-Tc cuprates, but also\nfinite dispersions in the incoherent part. Self-energy in a wide energy range\nhas been deduced from the ARPES spectral weight using Kramers-Kronig\ntransformation. The obtained self-energy has several structures which yield the\nincoherent feature and a pseudogap-like dip similar to the high-Tc cuprates.\nQuantum-well states in ultrathin films of SrVO3 have revealed sub-bands with\ncorrelated electrons. These findings of electron correlation effects outlined\nin the present article would provide a starting point not only for fundamental\ncondensed-matter physics but also for the development of new devices with\ncorrelated electrons.",

The presence of these high energy electrons may\nsolve the long-standing t^2/ADF puzzle, the observations that abundances\nobtained from recombination and collisionally excited lines do not agree, and\nthat different temperature indicators give different results, if they survive\nlong enough to affect diagnostic emission lines. The presence of these\nnon-Maxwellian distribution electrons is usually designated by the term kappa.\nHere we use well-established methods to show that the distance over which\nheating rates change are much longer than the distance supra thermal electrons\ncan travel, and that the timescale to thermalize these electrons are much\nshorter than the heating or cooling timescales. These estimates establish that\nsupra thermal electrons will have disappeared into the Maxwellian velocity\ndistribution long before they affect the collisionally excited forbidden and\nrecombination lines that are used for deriving abundances relative to hydrogen.\nThe electron velocity distribution in nebulae should be closely thermal.",

We study electron properties of three characteristic regions in the\nvicinity of the X-line. The fluid properties, velocity distribution functions\n(VDFs), and orbits are studied and cross-compared. On the magnetospheric side\nof the X-line, the normal electric field enhances the electron meandering\nmotion from the magnetosheath side. The motion leads to a crescent-shaped\ncomponent in the electron VDF, in agreement with recent studies. On the\nmagnetosheath side of the X-line, the magnetic field line is so stretched in\nthe third dimension that its curvature radius is comparable with typical\nelectron Larmor radius. The electron motion becomes nonadiabatic, and therefore\nthe electron idealness is no longer expected to hold. Around the middle of the\noutflow regions, the electron nonidealness is coincident with the region of the\nnonadiabatic motion. Finally, we introduce a finite-time mixing fraction (FTMF)\nto evaluate electron mixing. The FTMF marks the magnetospheric side of the\nX-line, where the nonideal energy dissipation occurs.",

The strong entanglement of the plasmon with the different\nlongitudinal optical (LO) modes make the role LO-plasmon coupling crucial for\ntransport. The electron density dependence of the electron mobility in\n\\beta-Ga2O3 is studied in bulk material form and also in the form of\ntwo-dimensional electron gas. Under high electron density a bulk mobility of\n182 cm2/ V.s is predicted while in 2DEG form the corresponding mobility is\nabout 418 cm2/V.s when remote impurities are present at the interface and\nimproves further as the remote impurity center moves away from the interface.\nThe trend of the electron mobility shows promise for realizing high electron\nmobility in dopant isolated electron channels. The experimentally observed\nsmall anisotropy in mobility is traced through a transient Monte Carlo\nsimulation. It is found that the anisotropy of the IR active phonon modes is\nresponsible for giving rise to the anisotropy in low-field electron mobility.",

The text aims at a\nmathematically clear derivation of such a separation. I will start the\ndiscussion with the total Hamiltonian of the system acting on a many-electron\nwave function, including the attractive interaction between nuclei and\nelectrons as well as the repulsive Coulomb-interaction between different\nelectrons. Indeed, a natural separation of the total Hamiltonian in the\ndescribed form will be obtained. An analysis of the tunneling Hamiltonian shows\nthat the electron-electron interaction yields contributions to it which\nrepresent the correlated tunneling of two electrons at the same time. For the\nderivations it was useful to introduce a map called \"antisymmetric product\". In\nan appendix I show possible exact representations of the total Hamiltonian\n(with arbitrary potential V(r)) obtained by the use of the antisymmetric\nproduct.",

    "summary": "Based on the quantum electrodynamics, we present a generic formalism of the\npolarization for beamed monochromatic photons scattered by electrons in any\nspectral distribution. The formulae reduce to the components of the Fano matrix\nwhen electrons are at rest. We mainly investigate the polarization in three\nscenarios, i.e., electrons at rest, isotropic electrons with a power law\nspectrum and thermal electrons. If the incident beam is polarized, the\npolarization is reduced significantly by isotropic electrons at large viewing\nangles, and the degree of polarization due to thermal electrons is about one\ntimes less than that of electrons in a power law. If the incident bean is\nunpolarized, soft $\\gamma$-rays can lead to about 15% polarization at viewing\nangles around $\\pi/4$. For isotropic electrons, one remarkable feature is that\nthe polarization as a function of the incident photon energy always peaks\nroughly at 1 MeV, this is valid for both the thermal and power law cases. This\nfeature can be used to distinguish the model of the inverse Compton scattering\nfrom that of the synchrotron radiation.",

    "summary": "We develop a variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method for electron-phonon coupled\nsystems. The VMC method has been extensively used for investigating strongly\ncorrelated electrons over the last decades. However, its applications to\nelectron-phonon coupled systems have been severely restricted because of its\nlarge Hilbert space. Here, we propose a variational wave function with a large\nnumber of variational parameters which is suitable and tractable for systems\nwith electron-phonon coupling. In the proposed wave function, we implement an\nunexplored electron-phonon correlation factor which takes into account the\neffect of the entanglement between electrons and phonons. The method is applied\nto systems with diagonal electron-phonon interactions, i.e. interactions\nbetween charge densities and lattice displacements (phonons). As benchmarks, we\ncompare VMC results with previous results obtained by the exact\ndiagonalization, the Green function Monte Carlo and the density matrix\nrenormalization group for the Holstein and Holstein-Hubbard model. From these\nbenchmarks, we show that the present method offers an efficient way to treat\nstrongly coupled electron-phonon systems.",

Employing a perturbative nonequilibrium Green's function approach, we\nstudy the influence of nonadiabatic electronic-vibrational coupling in model\nmolecular junctions. Thereby we distinguish between systems with well separated\nand quasi-degenerate electronic levels. The results show that the nonadiabatic\nelectronic-vibrational interaction can have a significant influence on the\ntransport properties.

This implies that the\nsingle-electron state is indeed entangled and, furthermore, nonlocal.

Our approach is based on the\nfactorization of the electronic wavefunction as a product of a marginal and a\nconditional amplitude. The marginal amplitude, which depends only on one\nelectronic coordinate and yields the exact one-electron density and current\ndensity, obeys a time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation with an effective\ntime-dependent potential. The exact equations are used to derive an\napproximation that is a step towards a general and feasible ab-initio\nsingle-electron approximation for molecules. The derivation also challenges the\nusual interpretation of the single-active electron approximation. From the\nstudy of model systems, we find that the exact and approximate single-electron\npotentials for processes with negligible two-electron ionization lead to a\nqualitatively similar dynamics, but that the ionization barrier may be\nexplicitly time-dependent.",

    "summary": "The dynamic capture of electrons in a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) by\nraising a potential barrier is a crucial stage in metrological quantized charge\npumping. In this work, we use a quantum point contact (QPC) charge sensor to\nstudy errors in the electron capture process of a QD formed in a GaAs\nheterostructure. Using a two-step measurement protocol to compensate for $1/f$\nnoise in the QPC current, and repeating the protocol more than $10^{6}$ times,\nwe are able to resolve errors with probabilities of order $10^{-6}$. For the\nstudied sample, one-electron capture is affected by errors in $\\sim30$ out of\nevery million cycles, while two-electron capture was performed more than $10^6$\ntimes with only one error. For errors in one-electron capture, we detect both\nfailure to capture an electron, and capture of two electrons. Electron counting\nmeasurements are a valuable tool for investigating non-equilibrium charge\ncapture dynamics, and necessary for validating the metrological accuracy of\nsemiconductor electron pumps.",

    "summary": "Experimental studies of electron-ion collision rates in an ultracold neutral\nplasma (UNP) can be conducted through measuring the rate of electron plasma\noscillation damping. For sufficiently cold and dense conditions where strong\ncoupling influences are important, the measured damping rate was faster by 37\\%\nthan theoretical expectations [W. Chen, C. Witte, and J. Roberts, Phys. Rev. E\n\\textbf{96}, 013203 (2017)]. We have conducted a series of numerical\nsimulations to isolate the primary source of this difference. By analyzing the\ndistribution of electron velocity changes due to collisions in a molecular\ndynamics simulation, examining the trajectory of electrons with high deflection\nangle in such simulations, and examining the oscillation damping rate while\nvarying the ratio of two-body to three-body electron-ion collision rates, we\nhave found that the difference is consistent with the effect due to many-body\ncollisions leading to bound electrons. This has implications for other\nelectron-ion collision related transport properties in addition to electron\noscillation damping.",

    "summary": "Correlated oxides, such as BiMnO$_3$ and LaMnO$_3$, show complex interplay of\nelectronic correlations and crystal structure exhibiting multiple first order\nphase transitions, some without a clear order parameter. The quantitative\ntheoretical description of this temperature dependent electronic-structural\ninterplay in the vicinity of a Mott transition is still a challenge. Here we\naddress this issue by simultaneously considering both structural and electronic\ndegrees of freedom, within a self-consistent density functional theory with\nembedded dynamical mean field theory. Our results show the existence of novel\nelectronic states characterized by coexistence of insulating, semi-metallic and\nmetallic orbitals. This state is in agreement with resonant X-ray scattering.\nWe also show that electronic entropy plays a decisive role in both electronic\nand structural phase transitions. By self-consistent determination of both, the\nelectronic state and the corresponding crystal structure, we show that the\ntemperature evolution of these phases can be quantitatively explained from\nfirst principles, thus demonstrating the predictive power of the theoretical\nmethod for both the structural and the electronic properties.",

    "title": "Bump formation in the runaway electron tail",
    "summary": "Runaway electrons are generated in a magnetized plasma when the parallel\nelectric field exceeds a critical value. For such electrons with energies\ntypically reaching tens of MeV, the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) radiation\nforce, in reaction to the synchrotron emission, is significant and can be the\ndominant process limiting the electron acceleration. The effect of the\nALD-force on runaway electron dynamics in a homogeneous plasma is investigated\nusing the relativistic finite-difference Fokker-Planck codes LUKE [Decker &amp;\nPeysson, Report EUR-CEA-FC-1736, Euratom-CEA, (2004)] and CODE [Landreman et\nal, Comp. Phys. Comm. 185, 847 (2014)]. Under the action of the ALD force, we\nfind that a bump is formed in the tail of the electron distribution function if\nthe electric field is sufficiently large. We also observe that the energy of\nrunaway electrons in the bump increases with the electric field amplitude,\nwhile the population increases with the bulk electron temperature. The presence\nof the bump divides the electron distribution into a runaway beam and a bulk\npopulation. This mechanism may give rise to beam-plasma types of instabilities\nthat could in turn pump energy from runaway electrons and alter their\nconfinement.",

Stripe-like and the related nematic morphology\nare also under intense scrutiny in various strongly correlated electron\nsystems. In contrast, the electronic bubble morphology is rare. Some of the\nmost intriguing electron bubbles develop in the two-dimensional electron gas\nsubjected to a perpendicular magnetic field. However, in contrast to bubbles\nforming in classical systems such as the Turing activator-inhibitor reaction or\nLangmuir films, bubbles in electron gases owe their existence to elementary\nquantum mechanics: they are stabilized as wavefunctions of individual electrons\noverlap.

    "summary": "Nanometer-sharp metallic tips are known to be excellent electron emitters.\nThey are used in highest-resolution electron microscopes in cold field emission\nmode to generate the most coherent electron beam in continuous-wave operation.\nFor time-resolved operation, sharp metal needle tips have recently been\ntriggered with femtosecond laser pulses. We show here that electrons emitted\nwith near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses at laser oscillator repetition\nrates show the same spatial coherence properties as electrons in cold field\nemission mode in cw operation. From electron interference fringes, obtained\nwith the help of a carbon nanotube biprism beam splitter, we deduce a virtual\nsource size of less than $(0.65\\pm0.06)\\,$nm for both operation modes, a factor\nof ten smaller than the geometrical source size. These results bear promise for\nultrafast electron diffraction, ultrafast electron microscopy and other\ntechniques relying on highly coherent and ultrafast electron beams.",

    "summary": "Recent experimental work has realized a new insulating state of samarium\nnickelate (SmNiO$_3$), accessible in a reversible manner via high-density\nelectron doping. To elucidate this behavior, we use the first-principles\ndensity functional theory (DFT) + U method to study the effect of added\nelectrons on the crystal and electronic structure of SmNiO$_3$. First, we track\nthe changes in the crystal and electronic structure with added electrons\ncompensated by a uniform positive background charge at concentrations of\n$\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{3}{4}$, and 1 electrons per Ni. The change\nin electron concentration does not rigidly shift the Fermi energy; rather, the\nadded electrons localize on NiO$_6$ octahedra causing an on-site Mott\ntransition and a change in the density of states resulting in a large gap\nbetween the occupied and unoccupied Ni $e_g$ orbitals at full doping. This\nevolution of the density of states is essentially unchanged when the added\nelectrons are introduced by doping with interstitial H or Li ions.",

    "title": "Simulation of nonlinear Compton scattering from bound electrons",
    "summary": "Recent investigations by Fuchs et al. [Nat. Phys. 11, 964 (2015)] revealed an\nanomalous frequency shift in non-linear Compton scattering of high-intensity\nX-rays by electrons in solid beryllium. This frequency shift was at least 800\neV to the red of the values predicted by analytical free-electron models for\nthe same process. In this paper, we describe a method for simulating non-linear\nCompton scattering. The method is applied to the case of bound electrons in a\nlocal, spherical potential to explore the role of binding energy in the\nfrequency shift of scattered X-rays for different scattered angles. The results\nof the calculation do not exhibit an additional redshift for the scattered\nX-rays beyond the non-linear Compton shift predicted by the free-electron\nmodel. However, it does reveal a small blue-shift relative to the free electron\nprediction for non-linear Compton scattering. The effect of electron-electron\ncorrelation effects is calculated and determined to be unlikely to be the\nsource of the redshift. The case of linear Compton scattering from a\nphotoionized electron followed by electron recapture is examined as a possible\nsource of the redshift and ruled out.",

The initial electron attached\nstate is found to be localized on the water and mixing of electronic and\nnuclear degrees of freedom leads to the transfer of electron from the water to\nthe uracil. The water molecules around the uracil stabilize the uracil bound\nanion by creating an extensive hydrogen-bonding network.

Because of the lack of periodicity, the metallic state is nonuniform in\nthe electron density even in the noninteracting limit. We clarify how this\ncharge distribution pattern changes with electron-electron interactions. We\nfind that the intersite interactions change the distribution substantially and\nin an electron-hole asymmetric way.

The discharge current is such that the\nthermalizing electron-electron collisions are negligible and the hydrodynamic\ndescription of electron component of plasma is not valid. Therefore, the\none-dimensional hybrid model is used which models the electron component by\nparticle method, while the ions are described using the drift-diffusion\napproximation. It is obtained that the electron transport is non-local in\nspace. The electron energy distribution in both discharges is of\nnon-equilibrium nature which is responsible for the non-linearity of the\nionization frequency. However, their dynamics in both discharges differs\nsignificantly. Namely, in the direct current discharge the distribution\nfunction is strongly modulated by the striations passage, while in the\nradio-frequency discharge the electron energy relaxation time is such that the\nelectron distribution function does not react on the oscillating electric field\nbut is defined by the effective electric field.",

The two-dimensional\ndistributions of electron density and electron temperature were calculated from\nthe spatial distributions of emission intensities via a collisional radiative\nmodel (CRM). It is found that the axial and radial distributions of electron\ndensity are more uniform at a lower RF power. The axial uniformity of electron\ndensity is better at a lower driven frequency, while the radial profiles of\nelectron temperature is flatter at a higher excitation frequency. In all the\ncases, the electron temperature is extremely uniform in the bulk plasma.\nMoreover, a mode transition from the {\\alpha} to the {\\gamma} mode is observed\nwith the increase of input RF power at 13.56 MHz, which causes a significant\nincrease of electron density and an abrupt decrease of electron temperature.",

The simulations show\nthat spatial width and amplitude of electron holes do not substantially vary in\nthe course of propagation, but there arises a double layer localized around the\nelectron hole and manifested as a drop of the electrostatic potential along the\nelectron hole. We demonstrate that electron holes produced around the neutral\nplane of a current sheet slow down in the course of propagation toward the\ncurrent sheet boundaries. The leading contribution to electron hole braking is\nprovided by the non-uniform magnetic field, though electrostatic fields typical\nof the current sheets do provide a noticeable contribution. The simulations\nalso show that electron holes with larger amplitudes are slowed faster. The\nsimulation results suggest that some of slow electron holes recently reported\nin the Earth's plasma sheet boundary layer may appear due to braking of\ninitially fast electron holes in the course of propagation in the current\nsheet.",

    "summary": "Electron hydrodynamics gives rise to surprising correlated behaviors in which\nelectrons \"cooperate\" to quench dissipation and reduce the electric fields\nneeded to sustain the flow. Such collective \"free\" flows are usually expected\nat the hydrodynamic lengthscales exceeding the electron-electron scattering\nmean free path $\\ell_{\\rm ee}$. Here we predict that in two-dimensional\nelectron gases the collective free flows actually occur at the distances much\nsmaller than $\\ell_{\\rm ee}$, in a nominally ballistic regime. The\nsub-$\\ell_{\\rm ee}$ free flows arise due to retroreflected holes originating\nfrom head-on electron electron collisions, which retrace the paths of impinging\nelectrons and cancel out their potential. An exact solution, obtained in\nCorbino geometry, predicts potential strongly screened by the hole backflow.\nScreened potential is described by a fractional power law $r^{-5/3}$ over a\nwide range of $r$ values, from macroscales down to deep sub-$\\ell_{\\rm ee}$\nscales, and a distinct non-Fermi-liquid temperature dependence.",

The intensity\ndistributions at the focus function are concave and convex electron round\nlenses, respectively. The convex lens formed by the azimuthally polarized beam\npossesses negative (opposite sign) spherical aberration compared with\nconventional electron round lenses created by electrodes and magnetic coils.\nThis remarkable result will contribute to the innovative design of\nelectron-optical imaging systems and bring new capabilities into matter-wave\noptics.",

The link between dynamical defections and\nnon-physical action configurations emerges naturally. On a quantum level, a\nself-consistent description for electron gyro-motion with self-force is\nconstructed in the Schr\\\"odinger-Maxwell theory. We derive a class of\nasymptotic equations. The leading and next-to-leading orders give a good\nanalogue of a classical cyclotron electron, and the limit field theory avoids\nclassical electron induced defections gracefully. Beyond the Hamiltonian\nperturbation theory, we use state-of-the-art geometric simulator to observe\nsingle electron gyro-motions at quantum region. The non-linear and\nnon-perturbative features captured by simulations provide a complete physical\npicture in a very wide range.

In transition metal\noxides, strong correlations characteristic of narrow $d$ bands is at the origin\nof such remarkable properties as the Mott gap opening, enhanced effective mass,\nand anomalous vibronic coupling, to mention a few. SrVO$_3$, with V$^{4+}$ in a\n$3d^1$ electronic configuration is the simplest example of a 3D correlated\nmetallic electronic system. Here, we focus on the observation of a (roughly)\nquadratic temperature dependence of the inverse electron mobility of this\nseemingly simple system, which is an intriguing property shared by other\nmetallic oxides. The systematic analysis of electronic transport in SrVO$_3$\nthin films discloses the limitations of the simplest picture of e-e\ncorrelations in a Fermi liquid; instead, we show that the quasi-2D topology of\nthe Fermi surface and a strong electron-phonon coupling, contributing to dress\ncarriers with a phonon cloud, play a pivotal role on the reported electron\nspectroscopic, optical, thermodynamic and transport data. The picture that\nemerges is not restricted to SrVO$_3$ but can be shared with other $3d$ and\n$4d$ metallic oxides.",

The\nrotational viscosity effect is responsible for interconnection between the\ndynamics of electron spins and flow inhomogeneities. In particular, it induces\nthe spin polarization of electrons in a curled flow via an internal spin-orbit\ntorque acting on electron spins. Here we show that this effect in an electron\nfluid placed in a magnetic field leads to a correction to the ac sample\nimpedance, which has a resonance at the Larmor frequency of electrons. In this\nway, via the electrically detected spin resonance the Womersley flow of an\nelectron fluid can be visualized and the rotational viscosity can be measured.",

One of the\nmost important wave mode for such scattering is the electromagnetic ion\ncyclotron (EMIC) mode. Within the quasi-linear diffusion framework, the\ncyclotron resonance of relativistic electrons with EMIC waves results in very\nfast electron precipitation to the atmosphere. However, wave intensities often\nexceed the threshold for nonlinear resonant interaction, and such intense EMIC\nwaves have been shown to transport electrons away from the loss cone due to the\nforce bunching effect. In this study we investigate if this transport can block\nelectron precipitation. We combine test particle simulations, low-altitude\nELFIN observations of EMIC-driven electron precipitation, and ground-based EMIC\nobservations. Comparing simulations and observations, we show that, despite of\nthe low pitch-angle electrons being transported away from the loss cone, the\nscattering at higher pitch angles results in the loss cone filling and electron\nprecipitation.",

    "title": "Spin-polarized hot electron transport versus spin pumping mediated by\n  local heating",
    "summary": "A `toy model' - aimed at capturing the essential physics - is presented that\njointly describes spin-polarized hot electron transport and spin pumping driven\nby local heating. These two processes both contribute to spin-current\ngeneration in laser-excited magnetic heterostructures. The model is used to\ncompare the two contributions directly. The spin-polarized hot electron current\nis modeled as one generation of hot electrons with a spin-dependent excitation\nand relaxation scheme. Upon decay, the excess energy of the hot electrons is\ntransferred to a thermalized electron bath. The elevated electron temperature\nleads to an increased rate of electron-magnon scattering processes and yields a\nlocal accumulation of spin. This process is dubbed as spin pumping by local\nheating. The built-up spin accumulation is effectively driven out of the\nferromagnetic system by (interfacial) electron transport. Within our model, the\ninjected spin current is dominated by the contribution resulting from spin\npumping, while the hot electron spin current remains relatively small. We\nderive that this observation is related to the ratio between the Fermi\ntemperature and Curie temperature, and we show what other fundamental\nparameters play a role.",

    "summary": "In view of immense interest to understand impact of an electron on atoms in\nthe low-energy scattering phenomena observed in laboratories and astrophysical\nprocesses, we prescribe here an approach to construct potentials using\nrelativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory for the determination of\nelectron-atom (e-A) elastic scattering cross-sections (eSCs). The net potential\nof an electron, scattered elastically by an atom, is conveniently expressed as\nsum of static ($V_{st}$) and exchange ($V_{ex}$) potentials due to interactions\nof the scattered electron with the electrons of the atom and potentials due to\npolarization effects ($V_{pol}$) on the scattered electron by the atomic\nelectrons. The $V_{st}$ and $V_{ex}$ potentials for the e-A eSC problems can be\nconstructed with the knowledge of electron density function of the atom, while\nthe $V_{pol}$ potential can be obtained using polarizabilities of the atom. In\nthis work, we present electron densities and electric polarizabilties of Be,\nMg, Ne and Ar atoms using two variants of the RCC method. Using these\nquantities, we construct potentials for the e-A eSC problems. For obtaining\n$V_{pol}$ accurately, we have evaluated the second- and third-order electric\ndipole and quadrupole polarizabilities in the linear response approach.",

    "summary": "We have studied the effect of amino acids on electron attachment properties\nof DNA nucleobases, taking cytosine as a model system. The equation of motion\ncoupled cluster theory with an extended basis set has been used to simulate the\nelectron-attached state of the DNA model system. Four selected amino acids,\nArginine, Alanine, Lysine, and Glycine which form a major component of histone\nproteins are considered to investigate their role in electron attachment to DNA\nnucleobase. The electron attachment to cytosine in all the cytosine-amino acid\ndimer complexes follows a doorway mechanism, where the electron gets\ntransferred from initial dipole-bound doorway state to the final\nnucleobase-bound state through the mixing of electronic and nuclear degrees of\nfreedom. In higher amino acid concentration, amino acid-bound state acts as the\ndoorway state, where the initial electron density is localized on the amino\nacid, away from the nucleobase. This leads to the physical shielding of\nnucleobase from the incoming extra electron. At the same time, the presence of\namino acids can increase the stability of nucleobase-bound anionic state, which\ncan suppress the dissociative electron attachment induced sugar-phosphate bond\nbreaking.",

Time-resolved\ncollisions between electrons have been used to probe the indistinguishability,\nWigner function and decoherence of single electron wavepackets. Due to the\neffects of screening, none of these experiments were performed in a regime\nwhere Coulomb interactions were particularly strong. Here we explore the\nCoulomb collision of two high energy electrons in counter-propagating ballistic\nedge states. We show that, in this kind of unscreened device, the partitioning\nprobabilities at different electron arrival times and barrier height are shaped\nby Coulomb repulsion between the electrons.

    "summary": "This paper investigates the mobility of electrons scattering from the coupled\nsystem of electrons and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons in n-type GaAs. The\nBoltzmann equation is solved exactly for low electric fields by an iterative\nmethod, including electron-electron and electron-LO phonon scattering\ndynamically screened in the random-phase-approximation (RPA). The LO phonon\nself-energy is treated in the plasmon-pole approximation. Scattering from\nionized impurities screened in static RPA is calculated with phase-shift cross\nsections, and scattering from RPA screened deformation potential and\npiezoelectric acoustic phonons is included in the elastic approximation. The\nresults show that dynamic screening and plasmon-phonon coupling significantly\nmodify inelastic scattering at low temperatures and densities. The effect on\nmobility is obscured by ionized impurity scattering in conventionally doped\nmaterial, but should be important in modulation doped structures. For\nuncompensated bulk n-type GaAs, the RPA phase-shift model for electron-impurity\nscattering gives lower drift mobilities than the standard Thomas-Fermi or Born\ncalculations which are high compared to experiment. Electron-electron\nscattering lowers the mobility further, giving improved agreement with\nexperiment though discrepancies persist at high donor concentrations\n($n&gt;10^{18}{\\rm cm}^{-3}$). When impurities are ignored, inelastic scattering\nfrom the coupled electron-phonon system is the strongest scattering mechanism\nat 77 K for moderate doping. This result differs from the standard model\nneglecting mode coupling and electron-electron scattering which has the\nacoustic modes dominant in this regime.",

We demonstrate that such a\nsetup acts as an entangler, i.e. it creates spin-singlets of two electrons\nwhich are spatially separated, thereby providing a source of electronic\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs. We show that in the presence of a bias voltage,\nwhich is smaller than the energy gap in the SC, a stationary current of\nspin-entangled electrons can flow from the SC to the LL leads due to Andreev\ntunneling events. We discuss two competing transport channels for Cooper pairs\nto tunnel from the SC into the LL leads. On the one hand, the coherent\ntunneling of two electrons into the same LL lead is shown to be suppressed by\nstrong LL correlations compared to single-electron tunneling into a LL. On the\nother hand, the tunneling of two spin-entangled electrons into different leads\nis suppressed by the initial spatial separation of the two electrons coming\nfrom the same Cooper pair. We show that the latter suppression depends\ncrucially on the effective dimensionality of the SC. We identify a regime of\nexperimental interest in which the separation of two spin-entangled electrons\nis favored. We determine the decay of the singlet state of two electrons\ninjected into different leads caused by the LL correlations. Although the\nelectron is not a proper quasiparticle of the LL, the spin information can\nstill be transported via the spin density fluctuations produced by the injected\nspin-entangled electrons.",

    "title": "Imaging electrons in a magnetic field",
    "summary": "We present simulations of an imaging mechanism that reveals the trajectories\nof electrons in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), as well as simulations\nof the electron flow in zero and small magnetic fields. The end goal of this\nwork is to implement the proposed mechanism to image the flow of electrons\ninside a ballistic electron device from one specific point (A) to another (B)\nin a 2DEG, using a low temperature scanning probe microscope with a charged\ntip. The tip changes the electron density in the 2DEG beneath it and deflects\nthe electrons traveling nearby, thereby changing the conductance from point A\nto point B. The simulations presented here show that by measuring the\ntransmission of electrons from A to B versus tip position, one can image the\nelectron flow. This forward scattering mechanism is well suited for imaging in\na magnetic field, in contrast to previous probes that depended on\nbackscattering. One could use this technique to image cyclotron orbits in an\nelectron focusing geometry, in which electrons travel from point A to point B\nin semi-circular paths bouncing along a wall. Imaging the motion of electrons\nin magnetic fields is useful for the development of devices for spintronics and\nquantum information processing.",

    "summary": "We obtain analytical expressions for the electron self-energy and the\nelectron-phonon coupling in electron-doped graphene using electron-phonon\nmatrix elements extracted from density functional theory simulations. From the\nelectron self-energies we calculate angle resolved photoemission spectra. We\ndemonstrate that the measured kink at $\\approx -0.2$ eV from the Fermi level is\nactually composed of two features, one at $\\approx -0.195$ eV due to the\ntwofold degenerate E$_{2g}$ mode, and a second one at $\\approx -0.16$ eV due to\nthe A$_{1}^{'}$ mode. The electron-phonon coupling extracted from the kink\nobserved in ARPES experiments is roughly a factor of 5.5 larger than the\ncalculated one. This disagreement can only be partially reconciled by the\ninclusion of resolution effects. Indeed we show that a finite resolution\nincreases the apparent electron-phonon coupling by underestimating the\nrenormalization of the electron velocity at energies larger than the kinks\npositions. The discrepancy between theory and experiments is thus reduced to a\nfactor of $\\approx$ 2.2. From the linewidth of the calculated ARPES spectra we\nobtain the electron relaxation time. A comparison with available experimental\ndata in graphene shows that the electron relaxation time detected in ARPES is\nalmost two orders of magnitudes smaller than what measured by other\nexperimental techniques.",

    "summary": "Kondo systems are usually described by the interaction of strong correlation\ninduced local moment with the highly itinerant conduction electrons. Here, we\nstudy the role of electron correlations among conduction electrons in the\nelectronic structure of a Kondo lattice compound, Ce$_2$CoSi$_3$, using high\nresolution photoemission spectroscopy and {\\it ab initio} band structure\ncalculations, where Co 3$d$ electrons contribute in the conduction band. High\nenergy resolution employed in the measurements helped to reveal signature of Ce\n4$f$ states derived Kondo resonance feature at the Fermi level and dominance of\nCo 3$d$ contributions at higher binding energies in the conduction band. The\nline shape of the experimental Co 3$d$ band is found to be significantly\ndifferent from that obtained from the band structure calculations within the\nlocal density approximations, LDA. Consideration of electron-electron Coulomb\nrepulsion, $U$ among Co 3$d$ electrons within the LDA+$U$ method leads to a\nbetter representation of experimental results. Signature of electron\ncorrelation induced satellite feature is also observed in the Co 2$p$ core\nlevel spectrum.

    "summary": "Different energy shifts for majority and minority electrons occur. Thus, for\nexample in case of (laser) excited ferromagnetic metals majority and minority\nelectrons may respond differently in time during closing the exchange\nsplitting. Spin flip transitions of the hot electrons due to electron\ninteractions cause quasi hybridization of the spin split states. This is also\nthe case in itinerant ferromagnetic metals due to hopping between sites having\nmagnetic moments pointing in direction of the magnetization (+) and opposite\ndirection (-) and with energy levels $\\varepsilon^+_{i\\sigma}$ and\n$\\varepsilon^-_{i\\sigma}$. For energetic reasons the molecular field acts\nasymmetrically on the spins of the electrons and on spin flip transitions and\nthus causes different lifetimes of minority and majority electrons and spin\ndependent electron energy shifts. Quite general minority hot electrons in spin\nsplit states may respond faster than majority electrons at non--equilibrium.\nThe molecular field acting on the spins delays spin flip transitions $\\uparrow\n\\rightarrow \\downarrow$ and thus a response of the hot majority electrons and\ntheir energy levels. The closing of the exchange splitting in the electron\nspectrum of ferromagnetic transition and rare--earth metals, ferromagnetic\nsemiconductors, spin split quantum well states in thin ferromagnetic films,\netc. will reflect this. The time and spin dependent energy shifts of electrons\nat non--equilibrium may cause interesting behavior, in particular of magnetic\ntunnel junctions, spin currents etc.. In ferromagnets the moment reversal\nlifetime of (local) magnetic moments parallel to the global magnetization is\nlarger than of moments pointing in opposite direction.",

Dedicated tests have shown\nbeampipe coatings dramatically reduce the density of electron cloud in particle\naccelerators. In this work, we evaluate the performance of titanium nitride,\namorphous carbon, and diamond-like carbon as beampipe coatings for the\nmitigation of electron cloud in the Fermilab Main Injector. Altogether our\ntests represent 2700 ampere-hours of proton operation spanning five years.\nThree electron cloud detectors, retarding field analyzers, are installed in a\nstraight section and allow a direct comparison between the electron flux in the\ncoated and uncoated stainless steel beampipe. We characterize the electron flux\nas a function of intensity up to a maximum of 50 trillion protons per cycle.\nEach beampipe material conditions in response to electron bombardment from the\nelectron cloud and we track the changes in these materials as a function of\ntime and the number of absorbed electrons. Contamination from an unexpected\nvacuum leak revealed a potential vulnerability in the amorphous carbon beampipe\ncoating. We measure the energy spectrum of electrons incident on the stainless\nsteel, titanium nitride and amorphous carbon beampipes. We find the electron\ncloud signal is highly sensitive to stray magnetic fields and bunch-length over\nthe Main Injector ramp cycle. We conduct a complete survey of the stray\nmagnetic fields at the test station and compare the electron cloud signal to\nthat in a field-free region.",

The significant\ninfluence of the contribution of the dynamics of produced nonthermal electrons\nto electron thermalisation and electron-phonon interaction is thoroughly\ninvestigated within a range of values of the pulse duration (i.e. from 10fs to\n2.3ps). The theoretical model elaborates firstly on possible transient changes\nof optical parameters during irradiation due to the presence of the\nnon-equilibrium electrons and the modification of the electron distribution\nfunction in a material characterized by a variable electron density of states\naround the Fermi energy. The model correlates the role of nonthermal electrons,\nrelaxation processes and induced stress-strain fields. Simulations are\npresented by choosing Nickel (Ni) as a test material to compute electron-phonon\nrelaxation time due to its large electron-phonon coupling constant that expects\nto reveal more conclusively the influence of the non-equilibrium electrons. We\ndemonstrate the consideration of the above factors leads to significant changes\ncompared to the results the traditional Two Temperature Model (TTM) provides.\nThe proposed model predicts a substantially (~33%) smaller damage threshold and\na large increase of the stress (~20%, at early times) which firstly underlines\nthe role of the nonthermal electron interactions and secondly enhances its\nimportance with respect to the precise determination of laser specifications in\nmaterial micromachining techniques.",

    "summary": "New schemes for the nuclear spin quantum memory are proposed based on a\nsystem composed of two electrons or one electron coupled to a single nuclear\nspin in isotopically purified group IV elemental and II-VI compound\nsemiconductors. The qubit consists of the singlet state and one of the triplet\nstates of two electrons or simply of an electron spin. These systems are free\nfrom the decoherence due to the nuclear dipole-dipole interaction and are\nadvantageous for the long memory time. In the case of two electrons, the\nprotocol for the quantum state transfer between the electron spin qubit and the\nnuclear spin qubit is based on the magnetic or electric field tuning of the\nsinglet-triplet state crossing and on the hyperfine coupling supplemented with\na well-defined scheme to initialize the nuclear spin. In the case of a single\nelectron qubit, the quantum state transfer is driven by the hyperfine\ninteraction itself without the need of the nuclear spin initialization. Many\npractical systems are considered, e.g., two electrons loaded on a Si or ZnSe\nquantum dot, a single electron charged state in a Si quantum dot doped with a P\natom, a single electron charged $ ^{28}$Si quantum dot doped with an isotope\natom of $ ^{29}$Si, and a localized electron system of Si:P and ZnSe:F in the\nbulk crystal.

    "summary": "A quantum theory of scattering of radiation by a stationary free electron\nbased on photon conception and relativistic kinematics, applying the principles\nof conservation of energy and conservation of momentum was proposed by Compton\nto explain the scattering of X-rays and {\\gamma}-rays by light elements. The\nrelativistic differential cross-section for the Compton scattering of a photon\nby a stationary free electron was formulated by Klein and Nishina using Dirac's\nrelativistic theory of electrons, and has been verified experimentally, when\nthe binding energy of the electron is negligible compared to the incident\nphoton energy. Here we show that the energy of scattered photons, and kinetic\nenergy of recoiled electrons obtained from Compton's quantum theory of\nscattering of radiation, show a degree of matching (that increases with the\nincrease of incident photon energy as quantified by chi-square test) with the\ndifferential Klein-Nishina electronic cross section per electron per unit solid\nangle for the scattering of an unpolarized photon by a stationary free electron\nwhen appropriate normalizations are invoked. There is a high degree of matching\nin a regime where the total electronic Klein-Nishina cross section for the\nCompton scattering on a free stationary electron scales as the inverse of the\nincident photon energy and the contribution of the electro-magnetic interaction\nto differential electronic cross section diminishes. Our results have\nsignificant implications to the foundations of quantum mechanics and to the\nunderstanding of the mechanisms of photon-electron interactions in the Compton\nscattering.",

Electron beams\nexpand along the trajectory, and using kinetic simulations, we explore the\nexpansion as the electrons propagate away from the Sun. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the front, peak and back of the electron beam in space from derived\nradio brightness temperatures of fundamental type III emission. The front of\nthe electron beams travelled at speeds from 0.2c--0.7c, significantly faster\nthan the back of the beam that travelled between 0.12c--0.35c. The difference\nin speed between the front and the back elongates the electron beams in time.\nThe rate of beam elongation has a 0.98 correlation coefficient with the peak\nvelocity; in-line with predictions from type III observations. The inferred\nspeeds of electron beams initially increase close to the acceleration region\nand then decrease through the solar corona. Larger starting densities and\nharder initial spectral indices result in longer and faster type III sources.\nFaster electron beams have higher beam energy densities, produce type IIIs with\nhigher peak brightness temperatures and shorter FWHM durations. Higher\nbackground plasma temperatures also increase speeds, particularly at the back\nof the beam. We show how our predictions of electron beam evolution influences\ntype III bandwidth and drift-rates. Our radial predictions of electron beam\nspeed and expansion can be tested by the upcoming in situ electron beam\nmeasurements made by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe.",

    "title": "Strong electron-phonon coupling, electron-hole asymmetry, and\n  nonadiabaticity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene",
    "summary": "We report strong electron-phonon coupling in magic-angle twisted bilayer\ngraphene (MA-TBG) obtained from atomistic description of the system including\nmore than 10000 atoms in the moire supercell. Electronic structure, phonon\nspectrum, and electron-phonon coupling strength lambda are obtained before and\nafter atomic-position relaxation both in and out of plane. Obtained lambda is\nvery large for MA-TBG, with lambda &gt; 1 near the half-filling energies of the\nflat bands, while it is small (lambda ~ 0.1) for monolayer and unrotated\nbilayer graphene. Significant electron-hole asymmetry occurs in the electronic\nstructure after atomic-structure relaxation, so lambda is much stronger with\nhole doping than electron doping. Obtained electron-phonon coupling is nearly\nisotropic and depends very weakly on electronic band and momentum, indicating\nthat electron-phonon coupling prefers single-gap s-wave superconductivity.\nRelevant phonon energies are much larger than electron energy scale, going far\nbeyond adiabatic limit. Our results provide a fundamental understanding of the\nelectron-phonon interaction in MA-TBG, highlighting that it can contribute to\nrich physics of the system.",

    "title": "Scattering of energetic electrons by heat-flux-driven whistlers in\n  flares",
    "summary": "The scattering of electrons by heat-flux-driven whistler waves is explored\nwith a particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation relevant to the transport of energetic\nelectrons in flares. The simulation is initiated with a large heat flux that is\nproduced using a kappa distribution of electrons with positive velocity and a\ncold return current beam. This system represents energetic electrons escaping\nfrom a reconnection-driven energy release site. This heat flux system drives\nlarge amplitude oblique whistler waves propagating both along and against the\nheat flux, as well as electron acoustic waves. While the waves are dominantly\ndriven by the low energy electrons, including the cold return current beam, the\nenergetic electrons resonate with and are scattered by the whistlers on time\nscales of the order of a hundred electron cyclotron times. Peak whistler\namplitudes of $\\tilde{B} / B_{0} \\sim 0.125$ and angles of $\\sim 60 \\degree$\nwith respect to the background magnetic field are observed. Electron\nperpendicular energy is increased while the field-aligned electron heat flux is\nsuppressed. The resulting scattering mean-free-paths of energetic electrons are\nsmall compared with the typical scale size of energy release sites in flares,\nwhich might lead to the effective confinement of energetic electrons that is\nrequired for the production of very energetic particles.",

    "title": "Electron-phonon and electron-electron interaction effects in twisted\n  bilayer graphene",
    "summary": "By comparing with recently available experimental data from several groups,\nwe critically discuss the manifestation of continuum many body interaction\neffects in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) with small twist angles and low\ncarrier densities, which arise naturally within the Dirac cone approximation\nfor the non-interacting band structure. We provide two specific examples of\nsuch continuum many body theories: one involving electron-phonon interaction\nand one involving electron-electron interaction. In both cases, the\nexperimental findings are only partially quantitatively consistent with rather\nclear-cut leading-order theoretical predictions based on well-established\ncontinuum many body theories. We provide a critical discussion, based mainly on\nthe currently available tBLG experimental data, on possible future directions\nfor understanding many body renormalization involving electron-phonon and\nelectron-electron interactions in the system. One definitive conclusion based\non the comparison between theory and experiment is that the leading order\n1-loop perturbative renormalization group theory completely fails to account\nfor the electron-electron interaction effects in the strong-coupling limit of\nflatband moir\\'e tBLG system near the magic twist angle even at low doping\nwhere the Dirac cone approximation should apply. By contrast, approximate\nnonperturbative theoretical results based on Borel-Pad\\'e resummation or $1/N$\nexpansion seems to work well compared with experiments, indicating rather small\ninteraction corrections to Fermi velocity or carrier effective mass. For\nelectron-phonon interactions, however, the leading-order continuum theory works\nwell except when van Hove singularities in the density of states come into\nplay.",
